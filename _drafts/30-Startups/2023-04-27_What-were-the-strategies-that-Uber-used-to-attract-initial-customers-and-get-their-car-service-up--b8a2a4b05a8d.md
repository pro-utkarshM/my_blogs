Uber is a ride-hailing service founded in 2009 that connects riders with
drivers through a smartphone app. It offers convenience and
accessibility, allowing riders to track their driver's location in
real-time and pay for the ride through the app. Uber has revolutionized
the way people travel in cities around the world and has expanded its
services to include a range of transportation options, such as UberX.
Its impact on the transportation industry cannot be overstated.

### What we'll cover here: {#7895 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="7895"}

Uber's early growth and acquisition of its initial customers can be
attributed to a combination of factors. Here's a breakdown of how they
did it:

> Finding customers

> Word of mouth

Finding customers exactly when they need your product is key to success.
One effective way to do this is by hitting them at the moment they are
experiencing pain and providing them with a solution that leaves them
wowed.

Word of mouth is a powerful tool for organic reach and can lead to
exponential growth for your company. However, for people to talk about
your product, it needs to hit a certain "wow factor." This is especially
true for products that solve a pain point for customers. The deeper the
pain, the lower the threshold for them to be impressed and share their
positive experience with others.

Uber understood this concept and aimed to hit people at the exact moment
they experience the pain of getting a taxi. To do this, they launched a
street team that camped outside crowded events like South by Southwest,
crowded train stations during peak hours, and local tech events. The
street team gave out free rides to everyone and then moved to discounted
rides.

The wow factors of this approach were clear:

-   [Get a ride when it's impossible to hail a taxi at an event]{#7ab1}
-   [Get it for free!]{#be36}

The normal reaction to such an experience is, "Wow, I love this!" And
this often leads people to tell their friends about it.

Contrast this with the experience of trying Uber for the first time on a
perfect Sunday afternoon with a line of cabs waiting outside the mall.
You may have to wait 5 minutes for the car to arrive and pay double what
you would pay for a regular taxi. The wow factor is not there, and the
likelihood of sharing the experience with others is low.

To find customers at the moment of pain, you need to understand their
pain points and be creative in finding ways to reach them. This could
involve partnering with event organizers or identifying peak times for
particular pain points. The goal is to provide an immediate solution
that is so impressive that customers are excited to share their
experience with others.

In conclusion, finding customers exactly when they need your product is
key to success. Hitting them at the moment of pain and providing a
solution that leaves them wowed can lead to exponential growth through
word of mouth. By understanding your customers' pain points and being
creative in finding ways to reach them, you can create a product that
solves their problems and inspires them to share their positive
experience with others.
