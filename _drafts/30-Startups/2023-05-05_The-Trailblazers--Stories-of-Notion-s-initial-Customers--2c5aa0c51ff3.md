### Notion's Origin Story {#c5fe .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="c5fe"}

More than a decade ago, in 2011, a young artist *Ivan Zhao* graduated
from one of the top Canadian universities: the University of British
Columbia. As a self-taught programmer from a young age, Ivan opted not
to get a formal education in programming, choosing to study cognitive
science (with a minor in photography) instead.

During those university years, Ivan fluctuated between pursuing a career
in academia as a cognitive scientist and one in art photography;
wherever Ivan went, so did his Contax T2 camera. He was a creative at
heart.

but soon after graduating, Ivan found himself on a 1-page portfolio
websites creation spree. Being the only geek in a circle of fashion
designers, artists, and creators, he was expected to put his technical
talent in the group's service.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*JVkD24nkQDFlo-RD.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*JVkD24nkQDFlo-RD.png" data-width="1456" data-height="1121"}

One of the first portfolio websites Ivan created

Sick of creating 1-page websites, Ivan set his sights on building
powerful software that would replace this agonizing task of churning out
1-page websites for his friends. He hoped that said software he was
making would unleash the creativity of non-programmers, who had the
vision and taste necessary to create self-expressive portfolio websites
but lacked the tools to do so.

Ivan quit his job at the digital publishing company, *Inkling, and*
teamed up with Toby Schachman to pursue this mission. Toby, at the time,
had just finished his Master's at NYU, where he published his entire
thesis on visual programming.

Visual programming was an elegant solution to the portfolio-creation
problem Ivan was so keen on solving. But Ivan and Toby set their eyes on
a much more ambitious project! Why stop at building a webpage builder?
Why not make a tool to create any generic web app that people can use
without learning how to code?

In 2013, they raised some Seed money and were onto the races. Along the
journey, they added one more person to the team: *Simon Last*.

Simon was an aspiring visual programmer. He was still pursuing his
bachelor's at the time and had connected with Toby over their shared
passion for creating visual programming projecting.

The two met up, and after a two-hour conversation, Toby convinced Simon
to quit his summer internship and join Ivan and himself on their mission
to democratize programming for everyone.

The trio set out to build the first experiment to validate the
hypothesis of creating a plug-and-play tool to create software. One of
the first prototypes they built was *Concept*. *Concept* made it easy
for people to collaborate live on building web pages.

The history here is a little unclear. But somewhere after the release of
Concept that Toby moved on to pursue other projects. Simon & Ivan stayed
persevered and found new collaborators in another team working on a
similar project.

The team was *Chris Prucha* and *Jessica Lam* the creators behind
SugarBox. Chris & Jessica met at Apple. The two quit their cushy jobs to
build a dead-simple SDK that can turn any website into a collaborative
one with one line of code.

One of the first companies to adapt Sugarbox was CodeAcademy.

The problem with Sugarbox, or Concept or the vision of democratizing
programming for creative people, was that it was not rooted in any
immediate frequent problem that the very same people they targetted
(non-programmers) faced. So when Chris, Jessica, Ivan & Simon teamed up,
they found it sound to wrap their powerful solution in an everyday
average Joe problem *creating documents.*

Enter Notion.

The work on Notion started in late 2013/early 2014. But, by early 2015
the project was still held at a standstill.

The app was constantly crashing, the real-time collaboration did not
work as intended, and the team faced a critical decision. Either start
the project from scratch on a new technical foundation or call it quits.

To add salt to injury, the small angel round they had raised two years
prior was not going to get them there no matter how far they stretch it!
The company was on the verge of bankruptcy with nothing to show for all
the teams hard work.

Simon & Ivan made the hard decision to part ways with Chris & Jessica.
The duo then moved to Kyoto, Japan, to rebuild the entire application
from the ground up. The move to Japan + slimming down the team gave them
some runway to give Notion a fighting chance to make it out into the
real world.

They sublet their San Francisco apartment and lived off the difference
between SF & Kyoto rental costs. Being in a new country --- where they
did not speak the language and did not know anyone --- meant Simon and
Ivan could spend all their time programming, designing, thinking, and
creating Notion.

In March 2016, almost a year after they hit the reset button on building
Notion, Ivan & Simon launched the product on Product Hunt. The launch
ended up being to be one most successful ones in 2016! Thousands of
people flocked to the Notion website to sign up and try this new
product.

The momentum from the launch helped Simon and Ivan raise a small bridge
room that gave them some breathing room to build what is now a \$10b
enterprise!

Today I'll be exploring **how and why the Notion launch was such a
success!**

Let's start with why- rationally it wouldn't be.

### Selling a "hard to get" product. {#3bfc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3bfc"}

> *Notion is sort of wiki, sort of Quip with a bit of Trello. \
> \~ Early Notion Adaptor*

The first problem a product like Notion has to overcome is explaining
exactly what this tool does! Notion's power is derived from its
**flexibility & adaptability**; instead of adjusting your workflow to
fit Notion, Notion molds its software to accommodate you & your team.
That very same power makes Notion exceedingly challenging to communicate
to potential customers. One just "has to try it to get it."

Notion is not the first company to face this problem. Many have
attempted to bundle different factures productivity software under one
overarching umbrella. What Notion did differently from its predecessors,
however, was to bundle **single-player productivity with multiplayer
productivity apps.**

Let's take a closer look at different productivity bundling solutions at
the time:

-   [Quip: Real-time collaboration on document + Chat]{#092f}
-   [Amium: File sharing + Chat]{#a9f0}
-   [Bear: Notes + Docs]{#e9c0}
-   [Notion: Docs + Wiki + Tasks]{#ccef}

Notion's wide-reaching bundle was possible because the product's core
was differentiated. The two core product differentiations are:

-   [A Canvas Structure: Notion steps away from the standard paper-like
    structure of documents and gives users blocks they can mix and
    match. All while maintaining consistent styling and allowing for
    seamless collaboration.]{#1b02}
-   [Flexibility & Adaptability: The blocks structure of Notion gives
    users the flexibility to build powerful tools that adapt to their
    needs rather than the other way round.]{#31b3}

These features help make explain why Notion chose Word + Confluence +
Trello bundle for their 1.0. This bundle strikes a balance between
having a low barrier to enter "low switching cost" for Docs, having a
high utility on single+multiplayer (all three), and highlighting the
product block-mixing power (differentiation).

On the other hand, Quip, Amuim, Bear, et al. were forced to make a
different set of choices. The core value proposition for these bundling
solutions was layering in an additional productivity functionality on
top of a familiar one. Hence, they had to go all-in Multiplayer utility
(e.g., combining chat with file sharing is only useful when you have a
meaningful number of team members using said software), making it harder
to gain mindshare or go all-in on single-player utility, making it
harder to monetize.

### Go To Market Strategy {#ef17 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ef17"}

99% of the growth of Notion is Word of Mouth (WoM) driven. Whenever I
hear WoM, I think of it as an obscure catch-all phrase that makes a
company more appealing to investors.

But in researching this piece, I wanted to understand **how exactly
Notion grew through Word of mouth? Especially when they didn't have an
established customer base or a following to lean on to kickstart the
process.**

It came down to a simple two-step process:

-   [Raise Awareness: launch on discovery platforms.]{#f3a6}
-   [Go viral: get those initial users to spread the Word.]{#dc05}

This may sound like a vanilla-abstract strategy, but it isn't.

1.  [**Awareness: launching on discovery platforms**]{#51a9}
2.  [Think of discovery platforms as places like Designer News, Hacker
    News, Product Hunt..etc. Websites with high traffic visited by a
    large number of geeks to find new products.]{#b5b6}
3.  [Every big product debut Notion made on any of these platforms ended
    up taking a life of its own. By just listing on one platform, they
    could find an initial set of users that would spread the product
    across a whole new set of other online communities and so on and so
    forth.]{#92d0}
4.  [Take the *2015 v0.5 Product Hunt accidental launch*. This was
    before the team moved to Kyoto and were still building Notion on the
    wrong tech Stack. An unintentional feature on Product Hunt ended up
    pouring down into half a dozen other online communities and getting
    Notion hundreds if not thousands of people knocking on their door to
    try out the product.]{#ef55}

-   [Not every launch on a discovery platform end up having the
    pour-over effect that Notion had. Why exactly this happened is
    because they were able to get those initial cohort of people to
    spread the word.]{#01d8}
-   [**Virality: getting people to spread the Word.**]{#1019}
-   [A product that spreads through WoM is simply a product that people
    love and want to be associated with! If we believe that to be true,
    then to get a product to spread through WoM, one ought to]{#1db4}
-   [Maximize user commitment to the product (i.e., association)]{#133e}
-   [Maximize the positive emotions (i.e., love) users have while using
    the product]{#3405}
-   [On the first point, one way to maximize user commitment is by
    getting them to invest time and effort in learning the ins and outs
    of the tool at hand. Most enterprise (or even consumer) software has
    a learning curve. The more you learn how to use the software, the
    more utility you can extract out of it.]{#9a4f}

1.  [Notion did an excellent job here at moving people along this
    learning/value curve **extremely efficiently** (without the need of
    a large CS or sales force) and **extremely fast.**]{#087b}
2.  [For the same \$4,\$8,\$12/month, Notion is a better bargain for
    someone on top of the Value curve than someone just at the start,
    and those are the people who would be **most motivated to spread the
    word about the product.**]{#41dc}

### Moving people along the value curve: {#84bf .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="84bf"}

There are infinite possibilities and use cases for Notion; this is the
power of being a malleable software. However, for the sake of this
research, I bundled them into four levels.

-   [Level 1: Single personal use-case]{#06b7}
-   [Level 2: Multiple personal use-cases]{#261c}
-   [Level 3: Company's source of truth]{#5bfb}
-   [Level 4: Lego blocks for creating productivity apps.]{#dce2}

A simplistic yet fun way to think of team-based software as a game. The
winner of the game is the person that convinces everyone on their team
to play their personal favorite game.

From a company's perspective, in our case, Notion, we established that
the goal is to get as many users to the highest-value level ASAP. By
doing so, the user would have invested just enough into being a master
of this game that they would be a lot more likely to recruit their
colleagues to play alongside them rather than attempt to master a whole
new game themselves!

But Notion, like any new company getting started, didn't have a magical
cohort of people who mastered their software and the block-first
architecture. What they had, was a good product sense that maximized the
number of people who reached the highest level of the *Notion Value
Stack*.

Let's take a look into what they did there:

**Getting users to Level 1**

Everything pre-sign-up on Notion is focused on **teaching people how to
use the product.** The end-state is left for the users to imagine. While
other more-established productivity software focused exclusively on
**what to use their product for** (i.e., the value proposition of said
software).

From Notion's landing page in 2015/2016

Once you know how to use Notion, it can be whatever you want it to be.
It could be a Wiki, a knowledge hub, a task management tool, a to-do
list, and the landing page is optimized to get you to think about what
that ideal use-case would be for you by showing you the power of the
tool!

**Getting users to Level 2**

After showing "what they can do." It was time to put some of that
learning into action. If Notion's Landing page was about the *what,* the
onboarding process was about the *how.* Onboarding on Notion was all
about **showing users how they could use the product.**

I could not access the early tutorial, but here are a few samples of
early feedback on the onboarding process that reflects just how much
effort they put into training people to be Notion Jedis.

> *"Fantastic onboarding flow! The "wow"-ing feature gifs followed by
> your interactive tutorial sold me."*

> *"This is the Mother All Demos... Congrats to the team, this is
> amazingly done!"*

> *"Looks really cool --- love the inset video"*

> *"This looks amazing and the onboarding process is really good."*

**Getting users to Level 3 & Level 4**

To get people towards the highest level of the value stack, moving from
the personal use-case to the multiplayer one, Notion did a few things.

**First** was allowing collaborators to bypass the early-access form. If
anyone wanted to an invite to *Notion,* the path of least resistance is
to find someone already using it and collaborate on that workspace.

**Second** was showcasing the power of *Notion* in a company setting.
Releasing [Notion's Product
roadmap](https://www.notion.so/What-s-New-Archive-588573f76dc04c6bad3dcda1a2f363f8){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.notion.so/What-s-New-Archive-588573f76dc04c6bad3dcda1a2f363f8"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} (built on Notion, of course) was how
they did that. The open-sourced roadmap showed "Notion in action" on an
enterprise level and highlighted all the new team collaboration features
that were just on the horizon.

(If a particular feature was what was holding you back, seeing it is
one, two, three weeks away gave people the confidence to adapt Notion
for their teams now, knowing they'll soon be (very well) served.)

**The third thing** was templates. The Notion v1.0 came with 30
templates team-ready templates that ranged from a design spec template
to a knowledge hub one.

When looking at all these things they did to move people along the value
stack, a couple of things stand out.

The first is how Notion's journey starts with a very simple
value-proposition that solves users' immediate problems, then guides
people towards "unlocking" more valuable use-cases.

The second is their pricing. Notion is priced **off the minimum value
the software can deliver.** At \$8 (later \$4 and now free) for personal
use, Notion was on par with Evernote, a personal note-taking app. But
Notion blows Evernote out of the water on Note-taking alone and is much
more powerful & versatile than just a note-taking app.

If the average company replaced 5--6 tools by adapting Notion (that is
just my very uneducated guess), then pricing it at \$20-\$30 would still
be a bargain for any enterprise. Yet, with aggressive under-pricing, all
the surplus value that users unlock as they build more powerful
use-cases feeds directly the company's growth potential through WoM
rather than their top line.

Notion's under-pricing, even their lowest-value competitor, makes it
almost criminal not to adapt Notion and spread it into the workspace.
Imagine working at a small startup that is stitching together Jira,
Google Docs & Confluence. They spend \$45 / user. With the switch to
Notion, they spent \$4/user and have all their data consolidated in one
place. If *no one got fired for buying IBM*, then surely no one will get
fired for buying Notion and dropping the company's productivity stack
costs by 90%+.

The more Notion widened the gap between cost & value, the more invested
users became in the product and, in turn, recruited friends, colleagues,
and collaborators onto the product.

And this is how the company grew like wildfire through "word of mouth."

### Some Learnings from writing this piece {#b3eb .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="b3eb"}

-   [You can build a very defensible business in a low-barrier-to-enter
    industry. Position for the low-barrier, gain Awareness and move
    people along the product value curve to build defensibility.]{#e16f}
-   [Sometimes it is best **not to communicate your value proposition!
    Start small and build it, especially if you build a product with a
    large surface area.**]{#f83d}
-   [To accelerate Word of mouth, help users extract more value from
    your product as fast as possible. Each product interaction is an
    opportunity to unlock the "next" value level.]{#4d0c}
