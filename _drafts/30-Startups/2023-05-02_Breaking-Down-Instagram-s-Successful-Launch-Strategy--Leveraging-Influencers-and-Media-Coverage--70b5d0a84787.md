**Creating a hyped launch**

The key to a successful product launch? Network, influencers, and media
coverage. Just look at Instagram's launch day, where they leveraged
[\@Jack](http://twitter.com/Jack "Twitter profile for @Jack"){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://twitter.com/Jack" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} and design influencers to get coverage in TechCrunch,
Wired, and more, resulting in a feature on the App Store and 25,000
users in just 24 hours.

30-second History Lesson
```

Kevin, ex-intern @ Twitter and PMM @ Google (after the company he worked
for got acquired by Google in his first year), started Burbn (the
precursor) to Instagram to help people discover whiskey places. He
raised \$500k for the idea after running into investors from
Baseline(Steve Anderson) at a party and showing them the app. \@Jack
also participated in the round, lending his support to his previous
intern.

``` {#106f .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="typescript"}
The Pivot
```

There was contingency on the money they raised. Steve Anderson would not
do the deal until Kevin found a cofounder. This was when Mike came to
the picture; he was an old friend of Kevin that also liked to tinker
with projects on the weekends, one meeting in....and he was on board
(talk about life-changing decisions)

But soon after, it was obvious to Kevin and Mike that Burbn was just not
that interesting to people. They only managed to take it to a hundred
users a few months after raising those \$500k (they were at 80 users
before raising any money). To focus their efforts, they did something so
simple yet so powerful...they asked the handful of users they had

> *Why do you still use Burbn?*

I just want to take a minute to uncover why this is such a powerful
question. For starters, it helps you re-discover your value proposition,
what is it that people appreciate about your product. Secondly, it helps
your team to identify the best ROI of their time. If you were to ask
them something like how could you make the product better or what
features they want....you would get pulled into 200 different
directions; that is not something you can afford in the early days.

``` {#e773 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="typescript"}
Building Instagram
```

1â€Š---â€ŠFocus

The original premise of Burbn was on Location sharing, which was hot hot
hot at the time. But from the handful of users they had, they found that
they were primarily using Burbn to share photos of mundane things. So
they had some initial direction

2- Study Competition

Kevin and Mike studied every competitor on the market to find how they
can build a competitive product (Path was all the rave back then ðŸ¤£).
And they decided to focus relentlessly on minimizing the number of
clicks to post a photo (spoiler alert: that wasn't enough)

3- Experimentation

Before Instagram, the duo developed a prototype named Scotch. It had a
similar premise to Instagram...but without the filter (and the UI was a
bit wack).

4- Do Something Special

Photo sharing in itself wasn't something special; what was special and
unique at the time was the amount of processing power one could do on
the iPhone 4. Taking a beautiful panorama and turning it into a cool
1980 polaroid is not just something you could do on any of the existing
"old-school" photo-sharing app.

The funny thing about filters, though, it did not come out of user
research or any unique insights the founders had. Instead, Kevin (after
being burned out by the failure of Burbn) was taking some time off with
his girlfriend, and after showcasing the new IG prototype, she said she
wouldn't post any pictures though because her photos weren't as good as
a Kevin's friend Greg(he used a separate filter app to make his photos
look nice). So Kevin, upon returning to work, added filters to the
Instagram prototype.

Teardown: Getting 25k Customers on launch day
```

**ðŸ’¡ Prelaunch**

Mike and Kevin only had 100 Testflight Beta Invites to give out before
launch, and so they treated them very specially. So they focused their
initial target on two main categories

1- Journalists....so they write about them when the app launches

2- Dribble.com, Top designers from Dribble meant that the quality of the
content that seeded the app would be out of this world. This fueled the
"wow" factor of Instagram. It is worth mentioning that they didn't go
with photographers because they were just a much more demanding segment.

**ðŸš€ Launch**

Kevin and Mike got \@Jack(ex-boss + investor) to tweet about it to his
1m followers and a dozen other design influencers([example

also got themselves covered in
[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/instagram-launch/){.markup--anchor

rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, plus many other publications(thanks to
some of those beta invites they set aside to reporters.

**Exclusivity == Value.**

A consequence of the PR + Influencer launch was that they also got
featured on the app store. This is not crazy because Apple ðŸ–¤
design-first companies... went from \<100 users to 25,000 in 24 hours!
Media is extremely powerful.
