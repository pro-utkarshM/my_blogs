Spotify is the ultimate music streaming service that has taken the world
by storm, and as a die-hard fanboy, I am thrilled to share with you the
story of how it grew to become the industry giant it is today. One of
the things that sets Spotify apart from other music streaming services
is its personalized playlists, which are curated specifically for
individual users.

### What we'll cover here: {#3cf5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3cf5"}

Spotify's early growth and acquisition of its initial customers can be
attributed to a combination of factors. Here's a breakdown of how they
did it:

Here are the milestones we'll cover:

> Falsely enhancing the value of a product to create the impression of a
> superior offering.\
> Engaging in negotiations with your arch-rival.\
> Accelerating TTPMF (Time To Product Market Fit)\
> The Launch Formula

### Falsely enhancing the value of a product to create the impression of a superior offering. {#5032 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="5032"}

Before streaming services came along you might have been guilty of using
controversial file sharing sites like Napster, LimeWire and The Pirate
Bay to download your music. Not only did Daniel had to convince the
music record labels who have been burnt by the tech industry to give up
all their most valuable assets for free at first (more on that later),
but he also had to convince people to pay for something they already get
for free. So how do you build something better than free? The answer for
Daniel was **speed.**

The human brain conceives anything that happens in less than 200ms as
"instant", and Daniel wanted nothing short of that. But to set the
scene, this was back in 2008, the first iPhone had just been introduced
a few years back, internet broadband was probably a tenth of it was
today and despite the thousands of engineering hours and 2 years of work
that went into achieving that goal, the best the engineering team at
Spotify could do was 500ms. So the team spent a ludicrous amount of time
creating the illusion of that "instant" magical feel. One of the things
they did was making the throttle (the bar showing progress on the song)
start immediately upon play rather than show a loading icon. The other
thing they did was downloading only the first 15 seconds from the
internet and complementing the rest of the song using p2p sharing
between Spotify users near you who have already loaded the song you are
about to listen to.

For customers, speed was Spotify's competitive advantage. It is what
made it X10 better than all the pirating websites that would sometimes
take hours to just download a single album. Daniel describes speed of
the product as "magical" it is what got Mark Zuckerburg, Sean Parker and
almost every tech blogger at the time to sing the praises of Spotify
almost as soon as it launched.

### Engaging in negotiations with your arch-rival. {#edca .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="edca"}

Most startups have the luxury to go around incumbent players and
"disrupt" their industries. After all, Uber didn't have to work with
Taxis, Airbnb didn't have to work with Hotels, Robinhood didn't have to
work brokers\... etc. Spotify, on the other hand, absolutely had to, if
it didn't want to suffer the same demise as Napster and Pirate Bay. To
get the music record labels onboard after an almost 2 and half year
negotiation Daniel did the following:

-   [Instead of negotiating a Global deal, he went after markets that
    have been crumbled by piracy. 80% of licensing revenue has been lost
    due to Sweden government's heavy investment in fair access to high
    bandwidth (meaning Swedish residents were able to download pirated
    music in minutes rather than hours as was the case in most parts of
    the world).]{#470c}
-   [He guaranteed music record label a one year revenue upfront, no
    matter what happened to Spotify.]{#385a}
-   [After he proved his model in EU, he allowed all major record labels
    to take a combined stake of almost 20% in Spotify (part of their
    Series A-B round) in part of a global copyright deal. Aligning
    incentives with your frenemies can be a beautiful thing.]{#8c3e}

### Accelerating **TTPMF** (Time To Product Market Fit) {#869f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="869f"}

Humans, in a gross generalization, are not creative creatures. Instead
what we are really good at is remixing ideas. The smartest people in the
world are, generally speaking, the best at absorbing and seeking
knowledge, and translating those acute insights and learnings in a
different domain or settings. In Andrew's essay he discusses how you
only need to innovate on the "top 20%" while your foundation, or your
80% stems from best practices and learnings from those who have made it
before you did. In Spotify's case their 20% was in embedding sharing as
a core not a parcel feature of the product.

Every playlist, every song was a de-facto URL from day one. To
demonstrate what that was like, here is what lifehacker had to say about
Spotify in one of the [very first product
reviews](https://lifehacker.com/spotify-is-the-best-desktop-music-player-weve-ever-used-5330148){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://lifehacker.com/spotify-is-the-best-desktop-music-player-weve-ever-used-5330148"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} about the company, published just a few
months after their public launch.

> ***Sharing any of your playlists is as easy as sharing a link:***
> *iTunes and other desktop players do a fair job of playlist creation,
> but if you want to share a playlist with a friend, your best bet is
> still to burn the mix to a CD. Yeah... old school, right? We've

> .markup--blockquote-anchor data-href="http://mixtape.me/"
> rel="noopener" target="_blank"} *(particularly notable to me because I

> *With Spotify, sharing a playlist you've created is as simple as
> right-clicking any playlist in the sidebar and selecting Copy HTTP
> link or Copy Spotify URI. Send either link to a friend via email and
> clicking on it should send them straight to that playlist in Spotify.
> It's dead simple. A web site has already sprung up* [*dedicated to

> .markup--blockquote-anchor data-href="http://sharemyplaylists.com/"

### The Launch Formula {#77dc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="77dc"}

Each market Spotify launched in, they did three things and did them
extremely well.

1.  [For their hardcore fans: they would debut the premium service a few
    weeks/months prior to introducing their free version. This way
    anyone who really wants access to the service before its available
    to everyone could pay (and they did). Thus capturing as much revenue
    as possible]{#ab07}
2.  [For the general public: they introduced a free version, but it was
    invite-only. Each new member was given five invitations that they
    could use to invite their friends, no less no more; making having a
    Spotify invite a valuable currency and a status symbol within the
    tech community]{#e661}
3.  [To seed each new market, they gave the first batch of invites to
    bloggers and notable techies. In the US for instance, Spotify also
    partnered with Klout, a service that measures online influence, to
    give out 15,000 to 20,000 invites. This way, as soon as Spotify
    launched in any new market, and as soon as any blogger wrote about
    them, they would get bombarded with people asking for invites (and
    engaging with their content). So they wrote more about the company,
    and the more they write the more people engage....you know how the
    flywheel goes.]{#e44b}
4.  [Pre-releases: for instance in the US just a few months after its
    launch there, Spotify allowed Premium users to listen to John
    Legend's new album Evolver, including two additional bonus tracks, a
    week before it is released to the public.]{#0b9b}
5.  [To put it all together, Spotify got their first 1 million customers
    by spending 2 years and 6 months negotiating with record labels and
    creating an extremely fast product by using some design hacks and
    building a P2P infrastructure. They went all in on-risk assumed
    excruciating losses in their first year by basically paying 100% of
    the revenue the Record Labels get from licensing music to the
    entirety of the Sweden. All whilst embedding social+music and
    creating some sort of network-effects to tech bloggers each time
    they write about the company.]{#4fc9}

I hope you found this blog post informative and thought-provoking. This
is just the beginning. In future blog posts, we will dive even deeper
into these topics and explore The Startup World. I'm excited to share my
knowledge and insights with you and to continue this journey of learning
and growth together. Stay tuned for more!
