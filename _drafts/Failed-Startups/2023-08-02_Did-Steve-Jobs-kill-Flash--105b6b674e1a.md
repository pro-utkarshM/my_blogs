### What was Adobe flash? {#47fe .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="47fe"}

Flash was a popular animation tool in the 2000s that allowed users to
view and stream video, audio, and multimedia. It was especially useful
for creating and running animations and games, as it could support
multiple formats such as GIF, PNG, and FLV.

Back in the day, internet download speeds were painfully slow. Flash
came to the rescue because its vector-based graphics resulted in tiny
animations that could be downloaded quickly. Flash became popular
because it was compatible with most browsers. Installing a simple plugin
was all it took to get started.

### The birth of Adobe Flash {#851d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="851d"}

In 1996, Jonathan Gay and Charlie Jackson launched FutureSplash Animator
to help people create animation easily. They had no idea their
experiment would take off the way it did. FutureSplash quickly became
one of the most popular animation tools available.

FutureSplash was acquired by Macromedia. A rebranded Macromedia Flash
1.0 was then launched along with a browser plugin called Macromedia
Flash Player.

The Flash player later got its popular name as "Adobe Flash Player" when
Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005.

### The peak era of Adobe Flash {#3aa6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3aa6"}

Flash started gaining popularity in the 1990s, and soon became a popular
tool. Anyone who was serious about building websites at the time used
Flash. Moreover, Flash was a huge hit among creative folks looking to
create interactive content on the web.

Its combination of multimedia content and interactivity made it a
versatile tool for creating engaging websites. Flash's easy-to-use
drawing tools and web player plugin allowed for a wide range of
possibilities for interactive content.

### Flash opens up a new world of gaming! {#3fba .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3fba"}

Tom Fulp created NewGrounds in 1998 as a website where people could
submit and play Flash games. It quickly turned into one of the biggest,
most active online user communities, built entirely on Flash.

Many Flash game developers made a lot of money, thanks to 18 million
monthly visitors to NewGrounds. The creators who featured on the
website's front page became wildly popular.

Flash changed the entire online landscape as it became popular in the
late 1990s and early 2000s. Suddenly, animation was everywhere, from web
games to websites to online videos. This led to the establishment of new
careers and companies in the animation industry.

### The many problems with Adobe Flash! {#0b73 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0b73"}

Flash's popularity and success was short-lived. People faced many
significant issues with Flash.

These were some of the major ones:

1\) Accessibility issues --- New Flash versions could only be installed
by uninstalling prior versions, which was a big pain. Users also had a
poor experience when HTML was mixed with Flash applications.

2\) Privacy concerns --- Flash used local data storage, which raised
many privacy concerns. Local storage contained sensitive data like
authentication information, site preferences, server-based session
identifiers, etc.

3\) Security issues --- Flash had a lot of security issues that were
never addressed. For instance, Adobe failed to fix a critical security
issue for an entire year in 2010 even though Adobe officially recognised
& apologized for the same. This led to people disabling Flash on their
devices to avoid potential security risks.

4\) Poor performance --- Flash was often criticized for being slow and
resource-intensive.

5\) Lack of mobile support --- Flash was not supported on most mobile
devices, which made it difficult to use on the go.

### Did Steve Jobs kill Flash? {#c7ba .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c7ba"}

Now, you'd be wondering what Steve Jobs has anything to do with Adobe
Flash.

Well, Jobs was never a big fan of Flash and very vocal about it.

On April 29, 2010, Jobs published an open letter called "Thoughts on
Flash". In this post, he voiced some major concerns about Flash:\
1) Flash had a closed ecosystem, and was proprietary in nature\
2) It was wholly owned and controlled by Adobe\
3) It required installing a separate plugin for it to work on your
browser\
4) Flash was designed primarily for mouse input, and did not support
touch gestures out-of-the-box. So, web developers would need to make
huge custom changes to support such gestures.

But Jobs' biggest concern was that Flash had really poor performance,
and serious security issues. Jobs even mentioned that Flash was the
number one reason for crashes on Apple devices at the time.

To top it all, Adobe was slow to add support for platform-specific or
native features in Flash. Jobs was very particular that any software
running on Apple devices should make full use of the native features of
iOS. So, this clearly irked him further.

So, it was a clear war between Steve Jobs and Adobe Flash. And, Jobs may
have been a contributing factor in Flash's demise.

### So, what happened to Adobe Flash? Did Adobe shut down Flash? {#b8dc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="b8dc"}

Post 2010, Flash started receiving a lot of backlash for its
performance, security, and privacy. This has led many of its users to
move to rising competitors. The flourishing of open source platforms
like HTML5 and CSS3 has also added to the fall of the software.

Google reported that the number of people visiting Flash websites fell
from 80% to 17%. In 2017, Adobe announced that it would be shutting down
Flash, and it was officially discontinued on December 31, 2020.

### What is Flash's legacy? {#7002 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="7002"}

Flash Player, the browser plugin, is as good as dead. But technically,
Flash, the authoring tool, is still alive and kicking.

Its usefulness has been reduced, but it remains a popular tool among
animators, and still retains an audience in various specialized business
settings.

Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, Flash still lives on NewGrounds (where
HTML5 has been supported for long) through open-source in-browser
emulation of select Flash content.
