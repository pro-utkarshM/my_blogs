### Are you torn between spending your time on competitive programming or software development? Let's explore the differences and benefits of each to help you decide where to invest your time and efforts. {#8646 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="8646"}

*Many people associate competitive programming with solving coding
questions on various platforms such as GeeksforGeeks, Codechef,
Topcoder, Codeforces, and Hackerrank, while software development
typically involves building applications, websites, mobile apps, and
addressing backend and scalability issues. Although competitive
programming can open up job opportunities, some individuals are
successful in software development without a background in competitive
programming. As a result, students may be left wondering where they
should focus their time and efforts. So, the question is, how should I
prioritize my time and effort between competitive programming and
software development?*

### Overview {#974e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="974e"}

### Competitive Programming {#cfa8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h3 name="cfa8"}

Competitive Programming (a.k.a. CP) is activities to solve coding
problems using algorithms and data structures. More specifically,
competitive programming is a competition to solve a problem with an
algorithm by writing a computer program. The computer program must be
able to produce answers within a certain period and with certain memory
limitations. Who can solve the problem faster and with less memory will
be everyone's goal (competitive programmer's goal)

The focus of competitive programming is the ability to find
problem-solving algorithms and implement these algorithms into a
computer program. Thus, other programming aspects such as graphical
interfaces, networks, databases, etc. usually do not need attention.
Competitive programming no needs human aspect like UI / UX or Clean
Code, it likes a black box when getting the input or test case it can
solve by code, and only aware of this problem could be solved by this
algorithm.

### Software Development {#61be .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="61be"}

Software development is the development of software that is run
systematically to produce a good quality product. The development is
dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying, and
supporting software.

In the world of developers themselves, this term is often referred to as
the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). SDLC is the life cycle of
software development. The purpose of using the SDLC itself is to build
an information system that is well planned to meet the target product to
be released. Instead of CP, Software Development not only focuses on
developing software, but also focuses on human aspects like interface,
experience, usability, and granularity.

### Where Should I Invest My Time? {#bde5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="bde5"}

### The Confusion {#2c40 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h3 name="2c40"}

Many software engineers who have graduated from university typically
have experience building applications using various frameworks. However,
not all of them have had exposure to competitive programming. Here are
some viewpoints from software engineers working at major tech companies.

> *"Although it adds to your skills, a good software engineer requires a
> lot more than what competitive programming has to offer. Competitive
> programming is not a necessity for being a good software
> engineer."* *--- *Satendra Verma, Software Engineer at Microsoft

If we talk about the opposite side then a lot of engineers also agreed
that taking part in CP helped them in grabbing a job opportunity to
become software engineers and make it easier for them at work.

> *"Competitive programming helps to crack the interviews of Google,
> Microsoft, Amazon. It helps me to improve code quality, but is in no
> way necessary" --- *Goutham Harsha, Software Engineer at Google

### Are competitive programming skills useful when working in the tech industry? {#a1e9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="a1e9"}

Almost all answers in Quora for the question above or related question,
the answer is definitely yes. Here are some aspects of competitive
programming that are useful for working in the tech industry:

1.  [**Knowledge of algorithm complexity (Big-O notation)**, both time
    complexity and space complexity. This is useful for making sure you
    know how efficient the code you are writing is relative to the size
    of the input. This analytical skill will be needed in large
    companies that deal with many users or big data.]{#31aa}
2.  [**Careful attention to edge cases**. The fewer and faster delivery
    trials we do in programming competitions, the more points we get.
    That is, competitive programmers have been trained to find edge
    cases in the problem in a fast time so that their code can solve all
    cases (test cases). In the world of work, this means that he is good
    at doing defensive programming]{#4dde}
3.  [**It develops your creative thinking.** Once you fail to accomplish
    the goal, you try to think differently, you try to learn from
    others' mistakes/success, and in a nutshell, you practice a lot.
    Practicing creates patterns in your mind, so whenever you face a
    particular situation, for which either you'd made a mistake or
    someone had, you quickly get the solution]{#f88d}
4.  [**It builds up your confidence and channelizes your energy.** For
    starters, you will fail a lot, but if you can positively take the
    failure, and can channel it towards success, and do more practice,
    you will after some time, be unbeatable.]{#120f}
5.  [**Readiness for technical interview (technical interview)**. In
    some technology companies, one of the stages of recruitment is a
    technical interview, where the job candidate will be given problems
    to solve. This is also a great material for a resume and easier to
    get online certification which can be kept on LinkedIn.]{#9e05}

### Does being proficient in competitive programming mean that we are 100% ready for the world of work? {#93d9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="93d9"}

Unfortunately not either. Here are some aspects of professional software
development that I don't think are acquired directly through competitive
programming:

1.  [**Ability to write clean code**. Code written for competitive
    programming is single-use code to solve only one problem, so it
    makes sense to write everything in one big main function with
    one-letter variable names. In the workplace, the code we write is
    likely to have a longer lifespan and will be read by others in the
    future, including yourself. So, it is a must that the code that we
    write must follow the rules that make it easy to understand and
    change, such as the concept of loose-coupling and high-cohesion, the
    existence of documentation, and the existence of tests.]{#c80f}
2.  [**Ability to deal with open or ambiguous problems**. Programming
    competition questions are generally closed questions that have clear
    descriptions and boundaries. In the professional world, this is
    often impossible --- most of the problems we face are ambiguous, and
    our programs must be able to anticipate the changes that ambiguity
    causes. This means we must be able to collect data that can break
    the ambiguity and assumptions that we may have had before.]{#465e}
3.  [**Ability to design a system on a large scale**. A system consists
    of components that interact with each other. In competitive
    programming, we create a component (code) that solves a specific
    small problem. One of our jobs is to combine such components to
    solve bigger business problems in the workforce.]{#0fec}
4.  [**Understanding SLDC and tools used in the professional
    programmer.** For example agile methods like scrum, version control
    systems like Git, DevSecOps cycle, continuous integration tools like
    Jenkins or TravisCI, project management tools, dependency management
    tools, and so on.]{#9815}

### Conclusion {#26db .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="26db"}

Competitive programming can be both enjoyable and beneficial for
improving programming skills, as it allows for practice with
problem-solving and thinking programmatically. While it can help with
technical interviews and job opportunities, it should not be the sole
focus for becoming a skilled developer or engineer. Rather, a
combination of software development skills and competitive programming
can lead to becoming a more reliable and proficient software developer.
