### The Dartmouth Conference {#7f35 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="7f35"}

The [Dartmouth
Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Conference){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Conference"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} of 1956 is a seminal event in the
history of AI, it was a summer research project that took place in the
year 1956 at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, USA.

The conference was the first of its kind, in the sense that it brought
together researchers from seemingly disparate fields of
study --- Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and others --- with
the sole aim of exploring the potential of Synthetic Intelligence (the
term AI hadn't been coined yet).

The participants included [John
McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_%28computer_scientist%29){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, [Marvin
Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}, and other prominent scientists and researchers.

During the conference, the participants discussed a wide range of topics
related to AI, such as natural language processing, problem-solving, and
machine learning. They also laid out a roadmap for AI research,
including the development of programming languages and algorithms for
creating intelligent machines.

This conference is considered a seminal moment in the history of AI, as
it marked the birth of the field along with the moment the name
*"Artificial Intelligence"* was coined.

The Dartmouth Conference had a significant impact on the overall history
of AI. It helped to establish AI as a field of study and encouraged the
development of new technologies and techniques.

The participants set out a vision for AI, which included the creation of
intelligent machines that could reason, learn, and communicate like
human beings. This vision sparked a wave of research and innovation in
the field.

Following the conference, John McCarthy and his colleagues went on to
develop the first AI programming language,
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. This language became the foundation of
AI research and still exists today.

The conference also led to the establishment of AI research labs at
several universities and research institutions, including
[MIT](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, [Carnegie
Mellon](https://ai.cs.cmu.edu/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://ai.cs.cmu.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, and
[Stanford](https://ai.stanford.edu/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://ai.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

One of the most significant legacies of the Dartmouth Conference is the
development of the [Turing
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, a British mathematician, proposed the
idea of a test to determine whether a machine could exhibit intelligent
behaviour indistinguishable from a human.

This concept was discussed at the conference and became a central idea
in the field of AI research. The Turing test remains an important
benchmark for measuring the progress of AI research today.

The Dartmouth Conference was a pivotal event in the history of AI. It
established AI as a field of study, set out a roadmap for research, and
sparked a wave of innovation in the field. The conference's legacy can
be seen in the development of AI programming languages, research labs,
and the Turing test.
