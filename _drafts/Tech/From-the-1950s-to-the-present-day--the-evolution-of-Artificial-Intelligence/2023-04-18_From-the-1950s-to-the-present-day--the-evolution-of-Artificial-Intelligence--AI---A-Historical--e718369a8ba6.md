### The AI Boom of the 1960s {#9177 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="9177"}

As we spoke about earlier, the 1950s was a momentous decade for the AI
community due to the creation and popularisation of the Perceptron
artificial neural network. The Perceptron was seen as a breakthrough in
AI research and sparked a great deal of interest in the field. This was
a stimulant for what became known as the *AI BOOM*.

The AI boom of the 1960s was a period of significant progress and
interest in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). It was a
time when computer scientists and researchers were exploring new methods
for creating intelligent machines and programming them to perform tasks
traditionally thought to require human intelligence.

In the 1960s, the obvious flaws of the perceptron were discovered and so
researchers began to explore other AI approaches beyond the Perceptron.
They focused on areas such as symbolic reasoning, natural language
processing, and machine learning.

This research led to the development of new programming languages and
tools, such as
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and
[Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, that were specifically designed for AI
applications. These new tools made it easier for researchers to
experiment with new AI techniques and to develop more sophisticated AI
systems.

During this time, the US government also became interested in AI and
began funding research projects through agencies such as the [Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. This funding helped to accelerate the
development of AI and provided researchers with the resources they
needed to tackle increasingly complex problems.

The AI boom of the 1960s culminated in the development of several
landmark AI systems. One example is the [General Problem Solver
(GPS)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-with/9781786464392/ch01s08.html){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-with/9781786464392/ch01s08.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, which was created by Herbert Simon,
J.C. Shaw, and Allen Newell. GPS was an early AI system that could solve
problems by searching through a space of possible solutions.

Another example is the [ELIZA
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, created by Joseph Weizenbaum, which was
a natural language processing program that simulated a psychotherapist.

The AI boom of the 1960s was a period of significant progress in AI
research and development. It was a time when researchers explored new AI
approaches and developed new programming languages and tools
specifically designed for AI applications. This research led to the
development of several landmark AI systems that paved the way for future
AI development.

### The AI Winter of the 1980s {#e05a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e05a"}

The AI Winter of the 1980s refers to a period of time when research and
development in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) experienced a
significant slowdown. This period of stagnation occurred after a decade
of significant progress in AI research and development from 1974 to
1993.

As discussed in the past section, the AI boom of the 1960s was
characteried by an explosion in AI research and applications. But
following that came the AI winter which occurred during the 1980s.

This happened in part because many of the AI projects that had been
developed during the AI boom were failing to deliver on their promises.
The AI research community was becoming increasingly disillusioned with
the lack of progress in the field. This led to funding cuts, and many AI
researchers were forced to abandon their projects and leave the field
altogether.

According to the [Lighthill
report](https://www.actuaries.digital/2018/09/05/history-of-ai-winters/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.actuaries.digital/2018/09/05/history-of-ai-winters/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} from the UK science research commission,

> *AI has failed to achieve it's grandiose objectives and in no part of
> the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact
> that was then promised.*

The AI Winter of the 1980s was characterised by a significant decline in
funding for AI research and a general lack of interest in the field
among investors and the public. This led to a significant decline in the
number of AI projects being developed, and many of the research projects
that were still active were unable to make significant progress due to a
lack of resources.

Despite the challenges of the AI Winter, the field of AI did not
disappear entirely. Some researchers continued to work on AI projects
and make important advancements during this time, including the
development of neural networks and the beginnings of machine learning.
But progress in the field was slow, and it was not until the 1990s that
interest in AI began to pick up again (we are coming to that).

Overall, the AI Winter of the 1980s was a significant milestone in the
history of AI, as it demonstrated the challenges and limitations of AI
research and development. It also served as a cautionary tale for
investors and policymakers, who realised that the hype surrounding AI
could sometimes be overblown and that progress in the field would
require sustained investment and commitment.
