### The Perceptron {#c21b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="c21b"}

The Perceptron is an Artificial neural network architecture designed by
Psychologist [Frank
Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in 1958. It gave traction to what is
famously known as the **Brain Inspired Approach to AI**, where
researchers build AI systems to mimic the human brain.

In technical terms, [the
Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptro){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptro"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} is a binary classifier that can learn to
classify input patterns into two categories. It works by taking a set of
input values and computing a weighted sum of those values, followed by a
threshold function that determines whether the output is 1 or 0. The
weights are adjusted during the training process to optimize the
performance of the classifier.

The Perceptron was seen as a major milestone in AI because it
demonstrated the potential of machine learning algorithms to mimic human
intelligence. It showed that machines could learn from experience and
improve their performance over time, much like humans do.

The Perceptron was also significant because it was the next major
milestone after the Dartmouth conference. The conference had generated a
lot of excitement about the potential of AI, but it was still largely a
theoretical concept. The Perceptron, on the other hand, was a practical
implementation of AI that showed that the concept could be turned into a
working system.

The Perceptron was initially touted as a breakthrough in AI and received
a lot of attention from the media. But it was later discovered that the
algorithm had limitations, particularly when it came to classifying
complex data. This led to a decline in interest in the Perceptron and AI
research in general in the late 1960s and 1970s.

But the Perceptron was later revived and incorporated into more complex
neural networks, leading to the development of deep learning and other
forms of modern machine learning.

Today, the Perceptron is seen as an important milestone in the history
of AI and continues to be studied and used in research and development
of new AI technologies
