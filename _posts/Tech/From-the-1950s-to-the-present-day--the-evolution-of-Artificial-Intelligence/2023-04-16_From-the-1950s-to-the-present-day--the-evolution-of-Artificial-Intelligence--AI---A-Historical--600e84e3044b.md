Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly important field
of computer science in recent years, with the potential to revolutionize
many industries and aspects of daily life. However, the history of AI
dates back to the 1950s, when researchers first began to explore the
possibility of creating machines that could think like humans. Over the
years, AI has gone through several waves of progress and setbacks, with
periods of intense optimism and excitement followed by periods of
disillusionment and skepticism. In this discussion, we will explore the
history of AI from its early beginnings in the 1950s to the present day,
examining key developments, breakthroughs, and challenges along the way.

Humans have always been interested in making machines that display
intelligence.

The Ancient Egyptians and Romans were awe-struck by religious statues
that were manipulated by priests behind the scenes.

Medieval lore is packed with tales of items which could move and talk
like their human masters. And there have been stories of sages from the
middle ages which had access to a
[homunculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} --- a small artificial man that was
actually a living sentient being.

And in fact 16th century Swiss Philosopher [Theophrastus
Bombastus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} said,

> *"We shall be like gods. We shall duplicate God's greatest
> miracle --- the creation of man."*

Our species' latest attempt at creating synthetic intelligence is now
known as AI.

In this article I hope to provide a comprehensive history of Artificial
Intelligence right from its lesser-known days (when it wasn't even
called AI) to the current age of Generative AI.

> programs. --- John McCarthy.*

### What we'll cover here: {#97c9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="97c9"}

This article will break down the history of AI into nine (9) milestones.
These milestones aren't disparate and unrelated. Rather, I'll discuss
their links to the overall history of Artificial Intelligence and their
progression from immediate past milestones as well.

Here are the milestones we'll cover:

> The Dartmouth Conference\
>  The Perceptron\
>  The AI boom of the 1960s\
>  The AI winter of the 1980s\
>  The Development of Expert Systems\
>  The Emergence of NLPs and Computer Vision in the 1990s\
>  The Rise of Big Data\
>  The Advent of Deep Learning\
>  The Development of Generative AI

We appreciate your interest in this ongoing topic and thank you for
staying updated. Please stay tuned for our upcoming articles where we
will share details of each milestone.
