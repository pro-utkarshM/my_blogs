# Crafting Your Own Operating System: A Kernel Development Journey

Discover the tricky trade of creating your own operating system by taking in my upcoming blogs on kernel development. From the basic Real Mode to the more complex worlds of Protected Mode, this practical journey covers a wide range of subjects essential to creating reliable operating systems.

## Real Mode Highlights:

### Legacy Real Mode Exploration
Explore Intel's legacy Real Mode processors, which bring back memories of the 8086 era. Explore the subtleties of memory management in this historical state and learn about the boot process.

### Hands-on Boot Loader Creation in Assembly
Experience the thrill of writing code in assembly language to craft your own boot loader. Witness the magic as your code is tested on a real machine, proudly displaying a simple "Hello World!" message on your screen.

### Introduction to Interrupts and Hard Disk Sector Reading
Navigate the world of interrupts in Real Mode and learn to read a sector from the hard disk. Lay the groundwork for future kernel development by gaining insights into these foundational concepts.

## Protected Mode Unveiled:

### Crafting a 32-Bit Multi-tasking Kernel
Elevate your skills as you transition to the advanced realm of protected mode development. Develop a 32-bit multi-tasking kernel, incorporating Intel's advanced memory protection features.

### Paging, Virtual Memory, and Memory Protection
Delve deep into the nuances of paging and virtual memory. Leverage Intel's memory protection features to safeguard your kernel and prevent user programs from causing harm.

### Building a FAT16 Filesystem Driver and Keyboard Drivers
Take your kernel development to the next level by creating a FAT16 filesystem driver. Develop keyboard drivers to enhance user interaction within your operating system.

## Advanced Skills and Tools:

### ELF File Loader Implementation
Unlock the power of ELF files as you implement an ELF file loader. Compile your operating system programs into ELF files, allowing for the loading of binary or ELF programs.

### Debugging Disassembled Machine Code with GDB
Master the art of debugging as you dissect disassembled machine code. Utilize GDB to debug your kernel in an emulator, gaining valuable insights into the inner workings of your creation.

## Bonus Section: Assembly Skills Refresher

### Ideal for Those New to Assembly Language
For those seeking to brush up on their assembly skills, this bonus section provides a refresher. While prior assembly experience is advised, this section ensures you can confidently apply your knowledge to the kernel development covered in the course.

## What You'll Gain:

- A fully functioning 32-bit multi-tasking kernel.
- In-depth understanding of memory management concepts.
- The ability to load and run ELF files within your operating system.
- Proficiency in debugging techniques using tools like GDB.

## Prerequisites:

- Proficiency in the C programming language.
- Basic knowledge of assembly language (recommended).
- Access to a Linux operating system, with Ubuntu being the recommended choice.
