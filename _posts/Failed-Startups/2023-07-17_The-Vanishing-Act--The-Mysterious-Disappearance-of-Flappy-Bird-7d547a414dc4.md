### What Was Flappy Bird? {#d4c8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="d4c8"}

Flappy bird was an arcade-style game which followed the pixelated bird
'Faby' and was controlled by the user. The game's objective was to
prevent Faby from hitting pipes present in the game's interface by
manipulating its elevation.

The gameplay was easy enough to understand. Faby automatically descends
and only ascends when the player taps on the touchscreen. The game's
pipes were suspended at varying heights with equally sized gaps between
them.

Each successful passage through the pipes earned the player 1 point. Any
collision of the bird with the pipes would end the game. The point
system also awarded medals to the player after crossing certain
thresholds. These include --

-   [A bronze medal for 10+ points]{#34a4}
-   [A silver medal for 20+ points]{#cbdb}
-   [A gold medal for 30+ points]{#cb2d}
-   [A platinum medal for 40 + points]{#9307}

Flappy Bird was created by Vietnamese developer Dong Nguyen in May 2013.
In early 2014, Flappy Bird became incredibly popular due to its simple,
yet formidable gameplay.

### What happened to Flappy Bird? {#7ad0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="7ad0"}

Nguyen's first introduction to the video gaming world was Super Mario
Bros. which he played as a child. He began coding his own games at age
16. While studying computer programming in college, he won an internship
in Punch entertainment, one of Vietnam's few video game companies.

Nguyen's objective for creating Flappy Bird was to introduce a simple
game to the market. He wanted to create a game that could be played by
people 'always on the move', anytime and anywhere. This purpose sprouted
from the most famous game at the time --- 'Angry Birds' which he felt
was too complicated.

The actual game was developed by Nguyen in approximately 2--3 days. The
main character 'Faby' was designed in 2012, for another platform game.
However, that game never saw the light of the day, and hence the design
was picked up and used for Flappy Bird.

The inspiration for the gameplay was taken from table tennis --- where
the objective is to keep the ball bouncing with a paddle for as long as
possible. However, to keep the game from being boring, Nguyen tightened
up its difficulty.

The Flappy Bird initial release date was 24th May 2013. It was launched
as a free app with in-game advertisements. After its release, the app
did not take off for a few months. However, after Swedish YouTuber
Pewdiepie reviewed the game on his YouTube channel, it received an
influx of players.

In January 2014, it topped the App Store charts and was the most
downloaded app by the end of the month. Nguyen also released an android
version of the app on January 30th of that year. Dubbed as a 'sleeper
hit', within a few weeks, the app became incredibly successful.

### How much money did Flappy Bird make? {#fe41 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="fe41"}

According to an interview with Verge, Nguyen claimed that the app was
bringing in a revenue of around \$50,000 a day with its in-app
advertisements.

### Why was Flappy Bird Deleted? {#6214 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6214"}

On February 8th 2014, 9 days after releasing the android version, Nguyen
announced on Twitter that he would be taking down Flappy Bird from all
platforms. This quick removal came as a shock to fans and many wondered:
Why was Flappy Bird removed? Did Flappy Bird get banned? If so, why did
Flappy Bird get banned?

Many speculated that it was due to legal copyright issues with Nintendo.
However, as confirmed by a Nintendo spokesperson and Nguyen himself, it
had 'nothing to do with legal issues.

So, why was Flappy Bird taken down? In an interview with Forbes, he
cited his discomfort with the addictive nature of the game as the
primary reason. Nguyen was racked with guilt due to its compulsive
effect on people.

He wanted to make a game that people could play for a few minutes when
they were relaxed. Unfortunately, however, it had the opposite effect.
Nguyen stated that he was losing sleep and could not 'take it anymore'.

Nguyen liked to stay elusive from the spotlight. However, with the
rising popularity of his app, there was a new interest in his persona.
The local paparazzi began houding Nguyen for an interview.

Overnight, Nguyen was sought after by many national and international
media outlets. He also began receiving a lot of online harassment and
backlash. This had a detrimental effect on Nguyen as he took refuge in
his parents house to escape.

This unlucky combination was also probably another reason for the game's
take down.

Nguyen's decision to take down the app was conscientious one --- one he
felt he had to take for the sake of himself and the world

### Flappy Bird after discontinuation {#6112 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6112"}

In August 2014, Nguyen released a revised version of the game 'Flappy
Birds Family'. This was a multiplayer game with new features and
obstacles --- designed to make the game less addictive.

However, Flappy Birds Family has not been his last advent in the world
of video games. He has since released many new gaming apps via his
software development company
