### From Onitsuka Tigers to Nike: The Evolution of a Brand's Customer Base {#211d .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="211d"}

The case study of Nike is distinctive from the others we have examined
thus far. Unlike a tech company, Nike has been in existence for over
half a century, and during the initial seven years of its inception, it
wasn't even producing shoes.

### The History {#3bd6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="3bd6"}

Prior to being rebranded as Nike Inc in 1978, the company was known as
Blue Ribbon. During its early days, Blue Ribbon did not manufacture its
own shoes but rather imported Onitsuka Tiger shoes from Japan and sold
them directly to runners initially, and later in stores.

The idea for Blue Ribbon was conceived when Phil wrote a paper during
his time at Stanford Business School, where he posited that Japan could
disrupt the European-dominated track shoe industry, just as they had
done with the German-dominated camera industry after World War 2.

The combination of factors such as low labor costs, rapid
industrialization, government incentives, tax breaks, and the
normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and the USA in the
1950s gave Japan a unique advantage in the global manufacturing arena,
as evidenced by Fujifilm's aggressive expansion overseas during that
period.

Phil argued that this phenomenon was not limited to the photography
industry, but would soon be seen in many different manufactured goods.
Although Phil could have made the argument for virtually any industry,
he chose track shoes as they had a special place in his heart, having
been a track athlete at Oregon, his undergraduate alma mater, until the
age of 24.

After completing his MBA, Phil would embark on an
I-dont-know-what-to-with-my-life world trip, during which he would make
a stop in Japan and convince Onitsuka Tiger (known as Onitsuka at the
time) to send him 12 pair of track shoes that he would try to sell in
the USA.

That first order took over a year for Onitsuka to fulfill. In 1964 Phil
would formally incorporate *Blue Ribbon* and embark on a journey that
would lead him to create one of the most recognizable brands the world
has ever seen. A brand so powerful that it would later serve as the main
inspiration for Steve Job's renowned "[Think

target="_blank"}" campaign.

### The road to their first 1000 {#1fb8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1fb8"}

**Selling the first 12 pairs:**

Phil heavily relied on his track coach at Oregon University, Bill
Bowerman, to help sell the first twelve pairs of imported Tiger shoes.
Bill was no ordinary coach; he was obsessed with providing his players
with a legal advantage in any way possible. He did this by experimenting
with his athletes' shoes and making modifications to them, as well as
inventing a drink to help them recover after long training days (which
was similar to Gatorade before Gatorade was invented). Bill went on to
coach over 30 US Olympic athletes.

Phil believed that if anyone in the world could determine if these Tiger
shoes were any good, it would have to be Bill. Therefore, the first
thing Phil did after receiving the twelve pairs of shoes was to gift two
pairs to coach Bill. Bill loved the shoes so much that he bought almost
the entire first shipment for his team. To top it off, Bill decided to
jump in as a 49/51 partner with Phil, becoming the second (and last)
co-founder of Nike.

**Selling the next 300 pairs:**

After the successful test batch, Phil wrote to Onitsuka, asking to
become their exclusive distributor in the western United States, and
immediately ordered 300 pairs of shoes. To sell the first "real"
shipment of Onitsuka Tiger shoes, Phil went directly to customers when
they were most susceptible to trying out a new pair of shoes: track
meets.

The advantage of selling at track meets was that the timeline from
purchase to "aha moment" was significantly faster than through any
traditional distribution channel. In under five minutes, a runner could
purchase a pair of Tigers, run in them on the track, return, and share
their unique experience with other runners who could buy them right
away.

To quote the legend himself:

> *MY SALES STRATEGY was simple, and I thought rather brilliant. After
> being rejected by a couple of sporting goods stores (" Kid, what this
> world does not need is another track shoe!"), I drove all over the
> Pacific Northwest, to various track meets. Between races I'd chat up
> the coaches, the runners, the fans, and show them my wares. The
> response was always the same. I couldn't write orders fast enough.*

Track sales and the ripple effect of word of mouth contributed to the
majority of the sales of the first 300 pairs. Nevertheless, Phil dabbled
a little bit with advertising:

> *Most people who came to the house had found me through word of mouth.
> Friend of a friend. But a few found me through my first attempt at
> advertising --- a handout I'd designed and produced at a local print
> shop. Along the top, in big type, it said: Best news in flats! Japan
> challenges European track shoe domination! The handout then went on to
> explain: Low Japanese labor costs make it possible for an exciting new
> firm to offer these shoes at the low low price of \$ 6.95. Along the
> bottom was my address and phone number. I nailed them up all over
> Portland.*

**Selling the following 1000 pairs:**

After exhausting track meets in Portland, Phil's next step was to expand
geographically and recruit a couple of salespeople. He chose California
as his first expansion ground, but there was a problem --- he couldn't
afford airfare every week because all his money was tied up in
inventory.

To overcome this obstacle, Phil dressed in his army uniform (he was
serving in reserves at the time), allowing people to assume he was an
active duty member. Airlines would then place him on the next available
military transportation to San Francisco or Los Angeles, free of charge.
However, traveling to California over the weekends was not enough to
sell all the track shoes, as Phil was a full-time accountant at the time
and could only travel during the weekends. He needed to hire
salespeople.

Jeff in his only happy place.

The first full-time employee and salesman would be Jeff Johnson. Jeff
was a fellow Stanford MBA and track runner. Before joining Nike (or Blue
Ribbon), he had a little side hustle going selling Adidas shoes.

It took a few months of convincing to get Jeff on board. But as soon as
that happened Jeff quickly became obsessed with the Tiger running shoes
and Blue Ribbon. The bad kind of obsessed 😬. To an extent where Phil
would soon start to question hiring him in the first place.

You see, for Jeff, running was life. It went to the point that he wanted
to exclusively socialize with people who shared and "understood" that
lifestyle (going for a run was something to be mocked in the 1960s).
Selling Tiger shoes was the only avenue available to him to connect with
fellow runner enthusiasts who could relate to him and running.

Although by accident rather than design, Jeff's desire to personally
connect and socialize with other runners would end up being the single
most significant lever that helped Nike (Blue Ribbon at the time) sell
their first 1000 pairs.

Fun Fact 😁: \
In the first year of his employment Jeff alone sold over 3200 pairs of
Tiger. This is equivalent to \$190,000+ in today's dollars (after
accounting for inflation).

Deep Dive 🧐: Conviction
```

``` {#3a4b .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
Phil has spent the first five years of his time at Nike (Blue Ribbon) working a full-time job, first as an accountant and later as a Professor. However, the people he hired- and arguably the reason how the company managed to double its revenue every year for the first seven years without any external capital- did not only "believe" in the mission, but they lived it and breathed it.
```

``` {#8d0f .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
Bill, Phil's ex-tracking coach and co-founder of the company, spent decades of his life trying to improve the weight of his athletes' shoes. Jeff, the first employee, wanted to live in a bubble with other runners who "got him." Bob Woodell (employee #5) and the right-hand man for Phil during the company's formative years, was a standout runner who lost the ability to walk in a frat house accident. Every single person on the "founding team" had a decade-long, complicated history with running.
```

``` {#a8a1 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
Some may even argue that they had more conviction in the benefit of running than Phil. Put another way, in 99/1000 parallel universes, had this company not existed, every single person on the founding team would have been something related to running and track.
```

``` {#e4ed .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
For your first ten hires, deep-obsessive conviction with the problem or domain trumps skills and/or experience 👏every👏 single👏time👏.
```

### The 7 year pivot to Nike {#46ac .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="46ac"}

image-id="0*lr_hL2z7AbQfCZw1.jpeg" data-width="480" data-height="270"}

\*Not\* how Phil was feeling during the pivot

Phil's relationship with Onitsuka would remain solid for seven years,
doubling sales almost every year until the executive team at Onitsuka
visits the US and see the humble offices of Blue Ribbon. Onitsuka's
ambition to dominate the US would get in the way of the success they're
seeing with Phil and push them to search for a more prominent
distributor with a more established operation.

During that trouble, Onitsuka tried to bully Phil into selling them his
company by threatening to break their exclusive distribution agreement
and poisoning Phil's relationship with his bank (which was financing all
his orders), basically just hanging Phil out to dry.

> *"Onitsuka Co. Ltd. will buy controlling interest in Blue Ribbon,
> fifty-one percent. It is best deal for your company. And you. You
> would be wise to accept." A takeover. A hostile freaking takeover. I
> looked at the ceiling. You gotta be kidding, I thought. Of all the
> arrogant, underhanded, ungrateful, bullying --- "And if we do not?"
> "We will have no choice but to set up superior distributors."
> "Superior. Uh-huh. I see. And what about our written agreement?" He
> shrugged. So much for agreements.*

The infamous Canada Nike that ironically ruptured under cold weather.

In fear of losing his company, Phil started searching for manufacturing
facilities to help him produce his own brand of shoes and to put him
control of his company's destiny. Under his contract with Onitsuka, Phil
was allowed to import/manufacture other shoes as long as they did not
fall in the track or running category.

On this to find his replacement for Onitsuka, Phil stumbled upon an
Adidas-approved manufacturing facility where he could re-appropriate one
of their soccer shoe designs to football(American football). This became
the first original Nike shoe and was named Canada.

**Selling the first 1000 Nike pairs:**

Nike Canada did not meet Phil's expectations or the quality of the
Tigers, with one of the first pairs sold disintegrating while being worn
by Notre Dame's quarterback. Subsequent releases were also unsuccessful.
With Onitsuka cutting ties and threatening legal action over breach of
contract, the team had to sell the poor-quality Nike shoes during the
National Sporting Goods Association Show in Chicago. This event was
crucial as it was the largest shoe trade show in the country. Despite
the quality issues, the team was surprised to find that buyers were
purchasing Nike shoes in large quantities, making them the hit of the
show. Everyone was confused by the unexpected success of the
not-so-great shoes.

``` {#ee6c .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="sql"}
Deep Dive 🧐: Trust
```

``` {#d9cd .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
When pressing some of their largest buyers during the National Sporting Goods Association Show as to why they were placing orders for the "totally untested and frankly not so great Nike shoes," the answer they got was trust. 
```

``` {#41d3 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
Throughout the past seven years, Phil and the team penetrated 70%+ of the track market. That social capital they accrued over the years paid off handsomely during that transition period. 
```

``` {#3ff8 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
As one of the buyers put it, "We've been doing business with you Blue Ribbon guys for years....and we know that you guys tell the truth. Everyone else bullshits. You guys always shoot straight. So if you say this new shoe, this Nike is worth a shot, we believe." 
```

``` {#2688 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
One of the reasons  Phil and the company, in general, were able to garner that high levels of trust with buyers over the years was that they believed in what they were selling. Phil and every single person on the team believed in running. They believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place. People, customers, and distributors alike sensed that belief and wanted it for themselves. 
```

``` {#2db8 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre .graf--trailing}
Takeaway: Buying into an idea- rather than a product- creates some of the most potent forms of trust.
```
