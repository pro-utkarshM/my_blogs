**The Cold Start** Problem is a common challenge that many startups
face, particularly in the online marketplace or e-commerce space. It
refers to the difficulty of attracting users or customers to a new
platform that has no existing user base or reputation.

In the case of Udemy, Gagan faced the Cold Start Problem when he started
cold calling instructors to create courses for their platform. Because
Udemy was a new platform with no existing reputation or success stories
of instructors making a living on their site, instructors were hesitant
to create courses for Udemy.

This is a classic example of the Cold Start Problem, as it is difficult
to attract users or customers to a platform that has no existing
reputation or user base. To overcome this challenge, startups often use
various strategies such as offering incentives, partnering with
established brands, or leveraging social media and other marketing
channels to build awareness and credibility.

**Startup Digest University.**

Gagan demonstrated resourcefulness and strategic thinking in addressing
Udemy's Cold Start Problem by creating Startup Digest University, an
offline event that could leverage the existing subscribers of the
Startup Digest newsletter. However, he realized that he needed
high-quality content to differentiate his offering and establish
credibility with potential customers.

To overcome this challenge, Gagan sought support from his investors and
presented a clear vision for the kind of content he needed. He
emphasized the importance of actionable insights, concrete examples, and
data-driven presentations. This approach helped him secure the necessary
resources and launch Udemy's first courses.

By focusing on customer success and using it as a case study to attract
more instructors, Gagan was able to build the supply side of the
marketplace and establish Udemy as a credible platform for online
courses. His approach highlights the importance of strategic thinking,
resourcefulness, and collaboration in overcoming the Cold Start Problem
for startups.

**Startup Digest University.**

Gagan had an easier time getting distribution to these courses than he
did try to get course creators on board ( it didn't take him six months,
that's for sure ðŸ˜‰). There are a few reasons for that:

1- Social Capital / Credibility of the instructors(Udemy investors)

2- Brand Recognition from Startup Digest

As you can imagine, Gagan utilized every distribution channel he had his
hands (asked investors to promote it, shoutouts in Startup Digest, asked
friends and acquaintances to promote it as well).

**Getting (actual) course creators on board**

With the case study in hand, Gagan created a 3 step funnel to find
potential instructors and convince them to create courses on Udemy:

1.  [Finding The Leads: Gagan needed a huge amount of leads. He
    accomplished by outsourcing the lead gen process for \$3 an hour to
    data miners in the Philippines using Odesk. In the past, Udemy used
    college interns but switched to outsourcing to increase efficiency.
    Udemy had 5 to 10 outsources working on lead gen at any given
    time.]{#c08d}
2.  [What did the outsources do? The lead gen teamed searched "learn
    python," "what is python," and any other search term related to a
    learning python (or any other topic Udemy wanted a course on). When
    the data miners found a relevant site, they'd copy/paste the web
    page author's email. This amounted to 100's of emails a day that the
    outsourcers would put in a Google doc.]{#e164}
3.  [Getting The Leads To Talk To Them Once they had the emails, the
    data miners would email, one by one, each address. Gagan didn't used
    Mailchimp or any other mass email service because it looked sketchy.
    The outsources sent a a variety of emails Gagan wrote beforehand and
    tracked which emails received a response. After 500 emails or so,
    the team would switch to the winning email.]{#b1ef}
4.  [Closing The Lead At this point, the data miners successfully had
    hundreds of instructors signed up for Udemy. But there was still a
    problem: the instructors rarely finish and launched their
    courses.]{#b8e3}

So Gagan got creative.

Udemy emailed any instructor who didn't finish creating their course and
said "Hey, we wanna run a promotion for your course in 3 weeks...can you
get it down by then?"

This email increased convinced instructors to finish creating their
course in a few weeks. It also increased the conversion to get people to
create a course in the first part.
