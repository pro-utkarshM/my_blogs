### Unveiling Canva's Winning Strategy: How They Attracted Their First Customers. {#a3d3 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="a3d3"}

**Design:** I get excited when I can incorporate visuals like timelines,
market maps, business models, or flywheels into my posts. However, I'm
not a designer and would be lost in tools like Adobe. Thankfully,
there's a startup that makes design accessible and easy for over 100
million people. They revolutionized the design industry by bridging the
gap between complex desktop publishing tools and simple web publishing
tools, creating a valuable service in the \$128 billion market. This
startup, hailing from Australia, makes everyone from small business
owners to Fortune 500 companies happy. Today, we're going to delve deep
into Canva.

**Alrighty, here's what to expect today:**

### How They Started {#9df3 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="9df3"}

Canva's mission is to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the world by
eliminating the limitations of design and enabling everyone to create
visually appealing content. Prior to Canva's inception, individuals were
forced to either hire a designer or resort to self-taught graphic
design, often resulting in unsatisfactory results. In 2013, Melanie
Perkins, Cliff Obrecht, and Cameron Adams introduced a free,
user-friendly design platform that catered to the needs of
non-professional designers. This platform featured an intuitive
interface, powerful yet straightforward tools, and stunning templates to
jumpstart creativity. Moreover, the platform was entirely web-based,
eliminating the need for software downloads and updates.

Today, excuses for poor design are scarce due to Canva's contributions.
However, when Melanie Perkins envisioned a future of integrated design
accessible to the entire world in 2006, it was met with skepticism from
hundreds of venture capitalists. Nevertheless, Canva persevered and
broke into the competitive world of design by collaborating with
industry giants Adobe and Microsoft to achieve Melanie's visionary goal.

### Big dreams (mostly) start small {#76f5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="76f5"}

The origins of Canva can be traced back to 2006, when Melanie Perkins
was teaching basic design to students at the University of Western
Australia in Perth. Through her interactions with students, Perkins
observed a recurring pattern --- many people who were not professional
designers found existing design software like InDesign and Photoshop
difficult and frustrating to use. This experience inspired Perkins to
explore a better solution.

> *I found that the design tools I was teaching were really clunky and
> difficult to use. I thought it seemed silly that they were all
> desktop-based and absurd that it took so long to use them. Facebook
> was taking off at the time --- people could jump in and use that so
> easily and yet design tools took years of training to learn.*

> Desktop design tools seemed excessively difficult and it seemed crazy
> they were desktop based.

> *People would have to spend an entire semester learning where the
> buttons were, and that seemed completely ridiculous.* ***I thought
> that in the future, it was all going to be online and collaborative
> and much, much simpler than these really hard tools.***

> --- Melanie Perkins, Co-Founder and CEO

She recalls the process of designing and printing a poster --- composing
it in Photoshop or Word, converting to the right size and saving as a
PDF, then going to a store to print. It all seemed cumbersome and
unnecessary in the age of the internet.

**💡*Wouldn't it be much better to do it all in one place with one
online tool?*💡**

The idea of making design really simple was born. And although [this
pitch
deck](https://www.canva.com/design/DACscqFA3s0/view#1){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.canva.com/design/DACscqFA3s0/view#1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} would not come for another few years,
these two slides sum up how Melanie was thinking about where design was
going, and how her big idea would fit in.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*QnJKdKeVYsxICMdS.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*QnJKdKeVYsxICMdS.png" data-width="1456" data-height="1885"}

The problem felt so obvious, and she feared if she didn't move fast
someone else would beat her to it.

Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht started small to quickly test their
ambitious idea by focusing on a niche that was underserved --- school
yearbooks. They identified that students who were not interested in
design found the available design tools hard to learn and use. Thus,
they hired freelancers to build a site called Fusion Books and launched
their operation, including printing, in Melanie's mom's lounge. Fusion
Books allowed students and schools to create their own yearbooks with
simple drag and drop tools and customizable templates. This initial
product became the core of Canva. Melanie and Cliff used
boots-on-the-ground tactics, tapping into their student network and
using direct mail and phone calls to get their first customers for
Fusion Books.

> *We experimented with direct mail campaigns to schools around
> Australia. Our families helped us to fold every letter, stuff every
> envelope and stick and lick the post-stamps. It was all very manual,
> but we learnt the ropes and got to learn about running and growing a
> business, developing software and marketing. Importantly,* ***we
> learned the fundamentals of how to create a product that provides
> enough value that people are happy to pay for it****.*

> *But were trying everything we knew how in order to find our
> customers. We flew over to attend an education expo in Sydney, there
> were more exhibitors than attendees so that was definitely a flop!*

> *In the end,* ***we found calling schools and sending them a sample
> yearbook proved to be the most effective way to generate leads.*** *We
> continued doing this every year, with our very kind families.*

> --- Melanie Perkins

Melanie and Cliff saw this as an opportunity to take their vision to the
next level, so they worked tirelessly to prepare their pitch. In 2012,
they landed in San Francisco with their Fusion Books pitch deck and
started taking meetings with venture capitalists. They found it
difficult to get investors interested, as they were a long way from the
established design centers of the world and most investors didn't see
the potential of their idea.

However, they persevered and eventually secured \$1.6 million in
funding, allowing them to take their product to the next level. They
changed the name from Fusion Books to Canva, and set out to create a
platform that would revolutionize the world of design. And the rest, as
they say, is history.

> *He was the first investor we'd ever met, and the short five minute
> chat felt like a window had opened into a whole new world.*

> ***We didn't really make a conscious choice between being bootstrapped
> or being funded. We bootstrapped because that was the only thing we
> knew when we started and we pursued funding because it seemed like the
> only feasible path to truly pursue our vision and build out 'the
> future of publishing'.***

> --- Melanie Perkins

After raising a seed round of \$3 million and founding Canva in June
2012, Melanie, Cliff, and Cameron were determined to democratize design
and change the way people create things. However, the road to success
was not easy, and they faced numerous rejections before recruiting
Cameron as their technical co-founder. Despite the challenges, they were
able to establish a fresh new entity, secure funding, and build a
founding team to start working towards their vision.

### Canva's early growth and GTM strategy {#b3f2 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="b3f2"}

Let's begin by examining Canva's go-to-market (GTM) strategy, which
employs a critical concept derived from World War II: the beachhead. 🪖
The techniques we'll examine here have led to impressive growth for the
company and offer valuable insights for aspiring entrepreneurs.

Moving beyond their GTM approach, we'll explore Canva's current drivers
of growth, which have resulted in an annual growth rate exceeding 100%
across several crucial performance indicators.

### Canva's path to 150K users {#160f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="160f"}

To make sense of Canva's approach to breaking into the market, let's
first look at a concept I came across while reading Geoffrey Moore's
iconic business book, "[*Crossing The
Chasm*](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-3rd-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0062292986/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1O95XKF7A2V1T&keywords=crossing+the+chasm&qid=1675683477&s=books&sprefix=crossing+the+chas%2Cstripbooks%2C55&sr=1-1){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-3rd-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0062292986/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1O95XKF7A2V1T&keywords=crossing+the+chasm&qid=1675683477&s=books&sprefix=crossing+the+chas%2Cstripbooks%2C55&sr=1-1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}*: Marketing and Selling High-Tech
Products to Mainstream Customers".*

We'll kick it off with this visual...

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*x9Oq6xzQ6qN5vUdE.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*x9Oq6xzQ6qN5vUdE.png" data-width="1080" data-height="720"}

Source graphic: Crossing the Chasm

The leftmost portion of the chart depicts a smaller gap, which
represents the initial challenge a new product must overcome to
transition from an abstract concept to something useful and appealing to
a broader audience beyond the limited group of passionate tech
enthusiasts known as innovators. Innovators are individuals who are
willing to experiment with nearly anything that offers novelty and
aligns with their values, regardless of bugs or other product issues
that the larger market may not tolerate.

> *The key to getting beyond the enthusiasts and winning over a
> visionary \[Early Adopters\] is to show that the new technology
> enables some strategic leap forward, something never before possible,
> which has an intrinsic value and appeal to the non-technologist.*

> ― Geoffrey A. Moore, [Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling
> Disruptive Products to Mainstream
> Customers](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/59649){.markup--anchor
> .markup--blockquote-anchor
> data-href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/59649" rel="noopener"
> target="_blank"}

Next, there is the daunting and sizable chasm, which is the primary
focus of the book and often marks the downfall of startups striving to
achieve mainstream success.\
As the above graphic illustrates, this chasm indicates a significant
divide between two separate markets:\
The early adopters and insiders → referred to as "Visionaries." These
individuals are quick to recognize the advantages of a new product as
long as it is functional and serves a purpose.\
The mainstream market → referred to as "Pragmatists." They desire the
benefits of new technology but are hesitant to endure the challenges
that come with it.

> ***Trying to cross the chasm without taking a niche market approach is
> like trying to light a fire without kindling.***

### Finding a beachhead {#5fa4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="5fa4"}

In other words, **the key to crossing the chasm is *positioning* and
securing a "*beachhead*" in a mainstream market.**

Okay, *what's a beachhead though?*

Simply put, **your beachhead is the smallest customer segment you can
target that serves as a point of attack into the main market you want to
break into. This niche has a set of characteristics that make it an
ideal place to focus your initial effort.**

While I learned about it in Geoffrey's book --- the idea actually goes
back to WW2.

> *It's a military strategy that advocates that, as you are approaching
> an enemy territory,* ***you should plan and focus all your resources
> on winning a small border area that becomes a stronghold area from
> which to advance into the enemy territory.***

> *The term references the 1944 invasion of Normandy where allied troops
> focused their attention on the Normandy beaches, which they used to
> stage a counter-invasion of Europe and win the Second World War.*

> *---* [via Corporate Financial
> Institue](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/beachhead-strategy/){.markup--anchor
> .markup--blockquote-anchor
> data-href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/beachhead-strategy/"
> rel="noopener" target="_blank"}

To illustrate...

![The strategy can be summed up
as follows:](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VdmHN6MPH59trEVC.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*VdmHN6MPH59trEVC.png" data-width="1080" data-height="720"}

Identify your beachhead (Who is our target customer?): Rather than
focusing on a target market or segment, focus on a specific target
customer that you can reach --- known as your High Expectation Customer
(HXC). This enables a more narrow and precise approach. Superhuman is an
excellent example of a company that has successfully employed this
strategy. You can learn more about how to find your HXC here.

Note that larger niches are not necessarily better than smaller ones. As
Geoffrey Moore notes, "the only time when a niche is too small is if
it's too small to generate half of next year's sales."

Develop the right product offer for your target customer (Why are they
choosing our product over the competition?): The main difference between
early and mainstream markets is that early adopters are willing to put
together the whole product themselves, while mainstream consumers are
not. Therefore, it's crucial to (1) develop a value proposition that
resonates with your target customer and (2) create a complete product
that solves all of their problems for a specific niche.

Nail your distribution (What channels will we use to reach these
customers?): Determine the most effective way to reach your target
segment. Discover where they hang out, both online and offline, and meet
them there.

Push into your next wave of target customers (How does this initial
customer group help us reach the rest of the market?): Once you've
established a foothold (i.e., your wedge), leverage that momentum to
penetrate further into the market.

And while *Crossing the Chasm* came out in 1991, that same
year...another person was centering their strategy around the same
principle. Only the mind behind what's now the most valuable company on
the planet.

### Taking a page from Steve Jobs' → finding their niche {#260d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="260d"}

If there's one suggestion I ever make that you take seriously, I hope
it's this one.

Watch this video by Steve Jobs talking about his strategy for *NeXT*
computers --- he articulates this idea of a beachhead *so* perfectly,
plus it's an 18 minute **masterclass on clarity and strategic
communication**. To me, this sits at the heart of not just
go-to-markets, but *marketing.*

And as we bring this quick theory session back to
Canva-specifics --- we'll see they did *exactly* this.

At the most zoomed out level --- Melanie and Cliff knew there was this
massive, growing, and underserved market of amateur/consumer designs.
And as we covered earlier, **they picked designers of school year books
as their beachhead.**

*Fusion Books* (a super niche product) then transformed into *Canva* (a
much more widely applicable tool). This approach helped them form a much
deeper understanding of their target audience and their
[Job-To-Be-Done](https://www.howtheygrow.co/i/78943812/milkshakes-finding-out-what-customers-want-from-your-product){.markup--anchor

data-href="https://www.howtheygrow.co/i/78943812/milkshakes-finding-out-what-customers-want-from-your-product"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} --- helping them craft a better product.

And with the earliest version of Canva, equipped with a more finessed
*whole product*, we can see they pushed a bit further into the
mainstream market they were after.

Source: Canva Pitch Deck

Canva acquired their first customers through content marketing and
word-of-mouth. They created a blog that provided tips and tutorials on
design and social media marketing, which helped them attract their
target audience. They also incentivized early adopters to invite their
friends by offering them additional features for every new user they
referred. This led to a viral effect, as satisfied customers brought in
more customers.

Canva also leveraged social media platforms like Twitter and Pinterest
to showcase their product and engage with their target audience.

Let's investigate.

### Leveraging communities for feedback and distribution. {#26b1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="26b1"}

Canva started out in a private beta and used waitlists to control
onboarding and build up demand. And before releasing publicly, they had
over 50K people waiting to get access.

*How?*

**The main thing they did was generate buzz within the design community
and adjacent groups needing design help**. Melanie and Cliff chased

rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, and reached out to blogs, podcasts, and
conferences to offer "early access" to their audiences.

**And anyone on the waitlist who tweeted about Canva usually onboarded
immediately. This pushed Canva's name further and drummed up more
hype.**

Taking a more gradual ramp up with waitlists is a highly effective
strategy ([tactics outlined here in our Superhuman deep
dive](https://www.howtheygrow.co/i/75972093/using-waitlists-to-hype-up-demand){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.howtheygrow.co/i/75972093/using-waitlists-to-hype-up-demand"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}) --- and **this closed beta allowed the
team to run a tight feedback cycle and iterate on the product before the
next bigger wave of customers were given access.**

rel="noopener" target="_blank"}

### Watching users, removing friction, and showing people how to use the product {#3512 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3512"}

To solve this problem, Canva went through a major redesign of their user
interface, making it simpler and more intuitive. They also added a
library of templates and design elements that their target customers
could use without any design experience. These changes made it easy for
users to get started and quickly create professional-looking designs.

In addition to the product changes, Canva also focused heavily on
content marketing to acquire their first customers. They created a blog
that provided design tips and tutorials, which helped to establish them
as a thought leader in the space. They also created free design
templates that people could use and share, which helped to spread
awareness of the product.

Overall, Canva's success in acquiring their first customers was due to a
combination of product improvements and strategic content marketing. By
identifying a specific pain point and creating a product that solved it,
while also establishing themselves as a leader in the space through
helpful content, they were able to attract and retain early adopters.

> *It became quickly apparent that it was not just the tools themselves
> that were preventing people from creating great designs, but also
> people's own belief that they can't design.*

> ***Users were scared to click much and when they did they wandered
> around aimlessly, struggled with a few things, created something that
> looked pretty average and then left feeling dejected. Not quite the
> fun journey we were hoping for users to experience.***

> *In order for Canva to take off --- we had to get every person who
> came into our product to have a great experience in a couple of
> minutes. We needed to change their own self belief about their design
> abilities, we needed to give them design needs and we needed to make
> them feel happy and confident clicking around. We needed to get them
> to explore and play in Canva. No short order! So we spent months
> perfecting the onboarding experience paying particular attention to
> users' emotional journey.*

> --- MP

So, **to boost confidence, new users went through a "how-to" guide
before entering the product. Canva also built very basic starter
challenges, like changing the color of a circle or adding a hat to a
monkey --- which helped users get familiar with the platform.** "We
continuously refined the experience until we got it to a point that
people could jump in, and within five minutes had designed something,"
says Perkins.

**This is a great example of how focusing on the customer and their
experience is key to kickstarting growth**. *Get rid of the friction!*

Ok, so following our beachhead framework here, that's how Canva did
***#2, "Get your product offer right for them"*** ✅. And below, we can
also see how Canva ticked off ***#3 "Nail your distribution".***

### Focusing on a use case that was inherently viral {#4dbe .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="4dbe"}

The niche use case that Canva picked for their GTM was designs for
Facebook --- this was tactically brilliant because at the time, **FB was
a great distribution channel to get Canva designs in front of as many
people as possible.**

The Facebook templates drove referrals as users invited their colleagues
to collaborate. It also drove word of mouth because when people posted a
Canva graphic on Facebook, others would ask how they made it.

Plus, **Canva made it super easy for users to share the design (*with
one click*) on Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter. By doing this, a small
number of users opened up a much larger audience.**

This graphic from Canva's seed deck illustrates this strategy perfectly.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OvmA7X7NTLgGsaYK.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*OvmA7X7NTLgGsaYK.png" data-width="1080" data-height="720"}

Another example of this was how Canva leaned into a seasonal
trend --- *holiday cards.* For their first holiday season, they
collaborated with artists to [create 30+
templates](https://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/12/prweb11382346.htm){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/12/prweb11382346.htm"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} for digital cards. **Most were
distributed via Facebook and email, which again funneled users back to
Canva**.

And the most important fuel to Canva's early growth was much simpler
than all of this. **People are inherently proud of their creations.**
Canva allowed people to create, and word of mouth organically drove a
ton of growth.

### Leveraging social proof vs paid advertising {#6e97 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6e97"}

These **early adopters** became Canva's growth engine by sharing their
designs with their friends.

> *Social currency in the sense of our community has always been
> incredibly valuable for us. More than 10 million people use Canva in
> 179 countries, and much of that growth has come through word of mouth
> and our users sharing about us.*

> --- MP

Lots of startups looking to kickstart growth go straight to paid
advertising, but besides hurting the bank, there's diminishing returns
when it comes to growth via ad dollars. As Reid DeRamus explains:

> *It's important to note that paid ads are often not the best way to
> drive growth early on. Like many other types of investments, investing
> in paid ads and marketing typically work best to* accelerate *growth.
> If it feels like you're pushing a boulder up the hill, it's probably
> best to avoid paid ads. But if it feels like the wind is at your
> back --- your product is in a good spot, you've found your audience,
> and you're experiencing solid* organic *growth --- paid ads can be a
> great way to amplify growth.*

> [--- Reid DeRamus (Growth at Substack), via Driving Growth with Paid
> Ads](https://reidtandy.substack.com/p/paid-ads){.markup--anchor
> .markup--blockquote-anchor
> data-href="https://reidtandy.substack.com/p/paid-ads" rel="noopener"
> target="_blank"}

*Ditto*.

**I'm a strong believer that in most cases, you want to get a
sustainable engine of growth working *before* leaning into paid
advertising. Not only because it's "free" growth that compounds on
itself, but because it's a signal that you have PMF**. *People don't
expend their valuable social credibility telling people about stuff they
don't like.*

That being said, while word of mouth is great (and often conflated with
viral growth), Ben Thompson raises an interesting point:

> ***The problem with a word-of-mouth business and exponential growth is
> people run out of people to talk to.***

> *That's the limiting factor. There's a little bit of exponential with
> every new subscriber, because they will tell new people, but networks
> get exhausted.*

Okay, we're at the point in Canva's growth story where what they did
next, I would have typically dubbed viral growth. *Except,* if I called
it that, I think I'd be wrong... 😬

and one of the chapters forever changed the way I think about growth.
\[...\]

**One of his most surprising findings (at least for me) was that going
"viral" is mostly a myth. We think that products often grow through
friends telling friends, who tell more friends, and this cascades to
so-called viral growth. It turns out this is almost never how products
grow. Instead, products explode in popularity when someone (or a few
someones) with a large platform shares the product with their
audience.**

Here's [Derek Thompson](https://twitter.com/dkthomp){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/dkthomp" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} describing this phenomenon:

> *People are social creatures --- they talk, they share, they pass
> things along. But unlike with an actual virus, a person chooses to be
> infected by an idea, and most people who confront any given thing
> don't pass it along. Viral diseases tend to spread slowly, steadily,
> across many generations of infection. But information cascades are the
> opposite: They tend to spread in short bursts and die quickly.*

> *The gospel of virality has convinced some marketers that the only way
> that things become popular these days is by buzz and viral spread.*
> ***But these marketers vastly overestimate the reliable power of word
> of mouth.*** ***Much of what outsiders call virality is really a
> function of what one might call 'dark broadcasters' --- people or
> companies distributing information to many viewers at once, but whose
> influence isn't always visible to people outside of the network.***

In his post, Lenny goes on to argue that **what we usually think is
"viral" hardly ever is. Most things aren't actually driven by "many
people telling many other people". Rather, it's the result of someone
with a large audience broadcasting it (i.e. one-to-many)**. Derek
Thompson gives this example in his book:

> *Imagine you go to work on a Monday and a coworker tells you about a
> new guacamole recipe she read in the New York Times. Several hours
> later, you go to lunch with another coworker, who asks if you've heard
> about the new guacamole recipe he read about in the New York Times.
> After work, you go home to your spouse, whose coworker evangelized a
> new guacamole recipe she found in the New York Times. The common
> observation is: "The Times article about guacamole went absolutely
> viral."* ***But the truer observation is that the article didn't go
> viral in any meaningful sense of the word. It reached a lot of people
> who read the recipe section of a large international newspaper, and a
> few of them talked about it.***

That being said, Lenny notes that optimizing for viral engines like word
of mouth is still important, and to kickstart (and restart) things like
word of mouth you need to invest in large one-to-many broadcasts (i.e
press, influencers, big ads).

Now, bringing this quick theory interlude back Canva.

-   [Canva continued to invest in mechanisms of virality --- like
    one-click sharing of designs to social media, referrals, and
    generally building a great/easy-to-use product people wanted to talk
    about.]{#5261}
-   [But, they also **invested in a strategy of driving growth via
    one-to-many broadcasts. This kept adding various turbo boosts (i.e
    one-off events that accelerate growth temporarily but don't last) to
    their word of mouth engine.**]{#d2c0}

According to Lenny and [Dan

### How Canva grows today {#75bc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="75bc"}

As far as I can tell --- there are 4 main forces behind this:

-   [**Product-led growth** (PLG)]{#54c0}
-   [Later adding on a **sales-led motion** to move upstream
    (SLG)]{#c00a}
-   [Using content and **winning SEO via backlinks**]{#6483}
-   [**Localizing and partnering** to expand geographically]{#4309}

Today we will only go deep on PLG, since (1) it's the core driver of
Canva's growth, (2) it's one of the most important for a B2C SaaS
company, and (3) there are *a lot* of brass tacks building lessons to
learn here. We'll lightly touch on the rest.

### Canva's deep PLG iceberg {#2fd3 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2fd3"}

> ***We live in the era of product-led growth****. Whether it means
> creating top of the funnel (ToFu) through virality, guiding users
> through their activation and engagement journeys, or taking the first
> steps in an assisted sale, at product led growth companies, the
> product is the lead actor, and sales, marketing, and engineering are
> the supporting cast.*

In other words --- **PLG is a growth model where product usage drives
customer acquisition, retention, and expansion.** It's a strategy where
the product takes center stage and converts users into paying customers
(vs sales or marketing). And for consumers businesses, where each
individual person is a decision maker, PLG is really the most effective
way to onboard and convert them. A normal sales process just isn't
feasible.

**Canva is a brilliant example of a company that understands how to turn
users into product-qualified leads (PQLs)**, which is great for growth
since PQLs convert to paid customers on average
[25%](https://productled.com/blog/product-led-growth-benchmarks-2022#:~:text=Free%20trials%20using%20Product%20Qualified%20Leads%20%28PQLs%29%20convert%20to%20paid%20customers%20on%20average%2025%25%20of%20the%20time.%C2%A0){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://productled.com/blog/product-led-growth-benchmarks-2022#:~:text=Free%20trials%20using%20Product%20Qualified%20Leads%20(PQLs)%20convert%20to%20paid%20customers%20on%20average%2025%25%20of%20the%20time.%C2%A0"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} of the time.

Now, before you get users whipping out their cards...*first things
first.*

When somebody is considering a new product, the very first thing they
think about, whether they know it or not, is **"how does this product
help me solve this problem I have?".**

The problem could be an aspirational one (i.e the desire to feel fancy),
or a practical one (i.e I need to drill this hole). **If that answer is
hard to find or poorly communicated, everything else inside the product
doesn't really matter, because nobody will care to get there.**

Analogy time.

**Think of it like an iceberg.** \[*Let me run over to Canva to
illustrate* 🧑‍🎨\]

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*y4tncHmEQ9KzTmvd.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*y4tncHmEQ9KzTmvd.png" data-width="1080" data-height="1080"}

Layer 1 and layer 2 are the easy-to-see showstoppers. It's what will
visibly causes a PLG company to fail, and it's essential to have right
if this is how a company is choosing to grow. That's why most PLG
companies end up getting this right. *Every single iceberg (even a baby
one) has a tip.*

But layer 3 and onwards are not technically essential and are harder to
perfect. But the companies that *do* nail each layer become bigger and
more formidable icebergs --- meaning they will stick around for a lot
longer. And this depth is what will sink competitors passing through. 🚢

Running with our iceberg analogy (which as far as I can tell we just
invented here 🤘), upon closer investigation we can see **Canva is doing
every single layer extremely well**.

### The tip → Communicating their value (L1 and L2) {#cf97 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="cf97"}

If I Googled something like "*how to make a logo*", I'd quickly find
myself on this page.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*V9pYqT2JTFxgGaWa.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*V9pYqT2JTFxgGaWa.png" data-width="1080" data-height="720"}

**Dead simple**, and super clear that Canva solves this problem for me.
And Canva has tons of search optimized landing pages for the breadth of
problems they solve for consumer designers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LUEZ4oJVpJalGblJ.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*LUEZ4oJVpJalGblJ.png" data-width="1456" data-height="647"}

Each page is personalized for the specific use case, and touches on
specific value points that somebody considering designing, say, a resume
will be thinking.

And given Canva is free to use --- this makes the decision easy to move
along.

Going deeper along the PLG iceberg....

### Removing friction during onboarding (L3) {#18b3 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="18b3"}

Canva's onboarding is seamless. They use single-sign on (i.e Google, FB)
to make creating an account simple, and **based on the landing page
you're coming from they bake in a lot of context around *why* you're
joining Canva.**

Then, with just a few easy questions --- they suggest templates that
will help you get the job done as quickly as possible (moving you closer
to that *Aha!* moment).

All in, getting from a landing page into the product, and having a
working canvas to start your design, takes less than a minute **This
makes Canva extremely easy to try, with literally no risk.**

**But onboarding goes beyond just the browser.** For example, if you
haven't taken an action within an hour of signing up, you get an email
with the subject "***Design? You can do that."***

After a user gets the first welcome email, if they haven't clicked on
the 'get started' button, they get some helpful and concise content to
encourage that first action. And once the user has activated (started
their first design) --- Canva sends out weekly newsletters that cover
things like: new templates, how to create on-trend designs, new
features, and the beginning of their upsell with the benefits of Canva
Pro.

**Canva keeps their marketing material practical --- focusing on
educating vs selling.**

Simply, because education brings users close to value, and *repeat*
value.

### Value discovery and Aha! moments (L4 and L5) {#ff0c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ff0c"}

Canva's whole shtick is that it's the easiest design tool, period.

And it has to be if they're on a mission to make design available to
anyone.

**The benefit of this is that they bring their learning curve *way*
down**. Education during onboarding can be friendly and more of a nudge,
vs "documentation" and intense product tours that can be overwhelming.

If you're downloading Adobe Illustrator, it'll be far longer before you
find yourself staring at a canvas you're proud of.

Take a look:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*m3zUXBRdhVQ6gsBt.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*m3zUXBRdhVQ6gsBt.png" data-width="1080" data-height="1500"}

Chalk and cheese.

Where the cheese here is clearly much less intimidating than traditional
design software. Meaning the time to an end-product that makes people
feel proud of themselves is orders of magnitude quicker.

As their CPO says, a key philosophy of theirs is "**have great
defaults**", and defaults along with a huge template library make
learning much easier. This makes the early discovery of the tool quick,
but still allows users to go deeper with functionality as they get more
comfortable.

And when it takes just 20 minutes to make a logo vs 20 hours...people
are likely to talk about it.

That's the shareable *Aha!* moment

### Aha! → again and again (L6) {#0adf .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0adf"}

**But providing just one key value experience isn't enough to build an
enduring business against. You to deliver value over and over
again **--- and ideally, you're not making that impossible by hiding
your core product value behind a paywall.

Canva gives us a masterclass on how to do this. Again, they're
free-to-use. But their freemium product isn't time based, and it's not
usage based (i.e you can only design 3 things). This gives people open
road to keep coming into Canva and making unlimited designs, forming a
habit around the tool. For a consumer business, this habit forming is
really important.

But, *how do they get people to keep coming back?*

First, they cover a huge range of use cases. **If you came for a logo,
you may well stay for presentations and social media posts.** And
there's a lot of sideways product marketing and education to get you
trying new things in Canva. This makes them much more sticky because all
your designs now live in one place.

Second, and this one is a biggie --- **Canva is vertically integrating
the value chain of design.**

Way back in 2006 when Melanie had the idea to make design easy, she
wanted "to take the entire design ecosystem, integrate it into one page,
and then make it accessible to the whole world". This was framed well in
their first investor deck.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*8ffyheGQeRsKHU_b.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*8ffyheGQeRsKHU_b.png" data-width="1080" data-height="720"}

**They've executed on that vision.** No more working across multiple
tools and piecemealing your workflow together. Canva has made one place
for everything, where they get to craft a perfect user experience. For
instance:

-   [An integrated stock library --- no more hopping around to Getty or
    Shutterstock.]{#2c15}
-   [Tools to edit images and designs. If Canva doesn't offer it
    natively, they have an app marketplace that covers a broad range of
    other use cases.]{#b92e}
-   [On-demand printing --- bringing your designs to your door, with
    free delivery.]{#e208}
-   [Sharing and collaborating --- no more exporting and using tools
    like Drive of Dropbox.]{#99f1}

And third, **Canva is obsessed with listening to their users and
evolving their product in response to their changing behaviors.** Here's
their Chief Product Officer and co-founder, Cameron Adams, to show you
how.

> *Building a good product or service is not a one-and-done effort. You
> need to be constantly listening to your community and coming up with
> new, imaginative ways of evolving your product or service to meet
> their needs (and defy their expectations).*

> *Take what has happened over the last 2 years: the COVID-19 pandemic
> has totally changed the way we (and many others) do business forever.
> \[...\]*

> *We saw the world's accelerated transition into a remote world of work
> as an opportunity to evolve our product to support our community. We
> noticed traditional ways of communicating and consuming information
> were changing, and teams and organizations were looking for more
> asynchronous tools to help facilitate communication, collaboration,
> and the breaking down of silos. We shifted all our time and energy

> rel="noopener" target="_blank"}*, real-time collaboration, comments
> and notifications to help them adapt to this new way of working.*

So b**y (1) covering a ton of design use cases, (2) vertically
integrating across all value stages, and (3) always evolving their
product to meet users needs, they've created one very sticky
ecosystem.**

Now, *what good is a sticky ecosystem if you're not making money with
it?*

### Monetization: Canva's free → paid conversion strategy (L7) {#6c75 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6c75"}

Canva's monetization strategy simple. Offer extensive free plans, help
people see value upfront, and back the product to engage and retain
people for long enough so they convert themselves into paid customers
that are less likely to churn.

When going after a large total addressable market of consumers --- free
plans are a key acquisition strategy.

**Once Canva has their engaged base of users set up, it's then about
segmenting them and finding the people that have a higher willingness to
pay. From here, they can focus on delivering extra value to those
segments.** For example, they realized that SMB marketing teams were
their sweet spot, turning their main Product-Led Sales playbook into [a
domino effect
strategy](https://www.howtheygrow.co/p/how-notion-grows){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.howtheygrow.co/p/how-notion-grows" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} (i.e converting individual users into teams). They lean
into this by dropping well-placed paywalls on features like premium
templates, brand guides, and advanced collaboration to nudge people
using Canva on [**single-player mode to shift into multi-player
mode.**](https://www.howtheygrow.co/i/73157189/removing-barriers-to-entry-through-single-player-mode-and-integrations){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.howtheygrow.co/i/73157189/removing-barriers-to-entry-through-single-player-mode-and-integrations"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}

Now, while they have paywalled features and obviously want as many
people as possible subscribing --- they do this very unobtrusively.

In an interview with Canva's Product Growth Lead, he says that **the
main way they actually drive this segment of people to their premium
offering is to "generally just let it happen", because they've found
that the people who use the product more frequently organically land on
the paywalls sooner, have the highest conversion rate, *and* lowest
churn rate.**

He goes on to say:

> *The question is, how irreplaceable is your product before you add
> that friction \[of a paywall\]? A lot of companies tend to get that
> balance wrong because there is always this perceived need to add the
> paywall sooner and get 5% of user paying today, vs waiting 3 months
> and getting 10% of users converting later.*

> *But this can be modeled out quantitatively --- ****if users get
> paywalls to soon, maybe you can convert a fraction of them upfront and
> get that revenue now, but if you invest in making a habit out of them
> and delay that gratification to a point where the product is an
> integral part of their lives, and you let them arrive there
> organically after using the product more --- a lot more users will opt
> into paying for your product.***

> --- Anshul Patel, Product Growth Lead at Canva

A great example of another consumer app that nails this balance is
*Spotify,* **who has a**
[**46%**](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-04-29/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2019-earnings/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-04-29/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2019-earnings/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} **conversion rate.** I remember when I
switched over from Apple Music back in 2018. I was broke and was more
than happy to stick to the free plan. At first, I was okay with only 6
skips an hour, or whatever it was. At first, the ads were peppered in
occasionally. But as the weeks passed and Spotify became part of my
everyday, the ads became more frequent and more annoying.

Eventually I paid. But if they'd made the free experience too gated (and
therefore less enjoyable), I may well have churned.

**Canva strikes this balance well**. Most people who've never "designed"
before would be very hesitant to pay too early. So Canva lets them build
habits and backs the downstream conversion.

*As an side: Canva has gradually also moved upstream, trying to get more
enterprise customers. And with enterprises come sales people. This
addition of a sales-led motion onto of a product-led one is very common.
If you're a PLG founder wondering what this might look like, there's*

need to know about adding a top-down motion to a bottom-up, product-led
foundation.*

**And now we get to the deepest level of the iceberg --- getting your
users to bring you more users.**

### Creating a growth loop (L8) {#92e4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="92e4"}

We've spoken about word of mouth already and how Canva facilitates this
with one-click publishing, etc. We've also just touched on teams...where
there's obviously an invite mechanism here. Both of those have a
flywheel effect. But let's look at something else in the works that
Canva has setup. 🧐

**At face value, you wouldn't think Canva is a marketplace.**

But under the hood, they've actually created [a *content
marketplac*e](https://www.canva.com/creators/){.markup--anchor

While that visual is Etsy-specific, you can imagine it works them same
way when pro designers can come in and list their templates/designs to
make passive income.

**And that's the Canva PLG iceberg.**

To summarize some action items to help you get your own iceberg in
motion, here is a great visual by Kyle Poyar, Partner an Open View and
author of Growth Unhinged.

The next driving force behind Canva's growth is content, which has
helped them build "a backlink empire".

### Content and winning at SEO {#9bae .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9bae"}

Canva is an excellent example of a company that's used content marketing
to build brand and drive real results using an inbound marketing funnel.
At the heart of their strategy sits this quote by Silicon Valley
marketer, [Regis
McKenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regis_McKenna){.markup--anchor

#### "The best marketing is education." {#5386 .graf .graf--h4 .graf--startsWithDoubleQuote .graf-after--p name="5386"}

All of Canva's content is around helping users create better designs on
Canva.

But content is a *massive* term. In [**our deep dive on
Intercom**](https://www.howtheygrow.co/p/how-intercom-grows){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.howtheygrow.co/p/how-intercom-grows"

> *Adaptation of graphic by Lenny Rachitsky*

Looking at where Canva sits in that quadrant, we can see that their
content is **created by employees and optimized for SEO.**

This strategy, dubbed by Lenny Rachitsky, is called
**Editorially-Generated SEO-Optimized (EGSO).** People on the Canva team
create content with the goal of ranking higher for certain keywords.
Besides Canva, this helps drives the growth of companies like
[**Ahrefs**](https://ahrefs.com/blog/most-visited-websites/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/most-visited-websites/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}**,**
[**Intercom**](https://www.intercom.com/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://www.intercom.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}**,** and
[**HubSpot**](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-segmentation){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-segmentation"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

And in short, Canva succeeds here by:

1.  [Creating value-adding content to help user build design skills
    (educate) and get the most out of the product;]{#6523}
2.  [Solution-focused SEO using a Jobs-To-Be-Done intent strategy (AKA
    Jobs-based marketing);]{#72d6}
3.  [Building a scalable backlink program (driving domain authority) via
    active outreach]{#1e86}
4.  [Staying on top of cultural trends and creating content to remain
    relevant]{#2b4e}

### Strategy 1: Value-adding Content {#ad95 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="ad95"}

All of Canva's content --- from their blog, articles, and design
school --- is focused on education, and either making people feel either
more confident to create their first design, or inspiring them to
develop their skills and push how they use the tool. This helps reduce
friction in their market of "amateur/consumer designers) and build
Canva's brand.

*The takeaway?*

**Get your content to:**

-   [Help people get their desired job/task done better and
    faster]{#3f62}
-   [Educate --- help build skills]{#3bb5}
-   [Help people get more out of your product (maximize the
    value)]{#1983}

### Strategy 2: Content that matches user intent {#41e6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="41e6"}

**Simply, search intent is the purpose of a user's search.**

When you type something into search, Google makes assumptions about what
you're trying to find (your goal), and serves you what they think are
the most relevant results.

And how well you understand search intent as part of your content
strategy impacts your ability to rank and whether the people that come
to your pages are satisfied with your content.

**Canva uses a goal-related and solution focused keyword strategy for
SEO.** They focus on what their users are trying to achieve (i.e make a
logo), and then connect them to a specific solution they're looking for
on a dedicated landing page (i.e a free logo maker).

The keywords they use are all based on jobs you can accomplish with the
product --- paving the way for high conversion rates because they do an
excellent job at bringing users to content that is super relevant.

### Strategy 3: Building a backlink program {#59ad .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="59ad"}

Backlinks are all the inbound links to your content. The more people
that drop in URLs to your stuff, the higher you rank on search. But...

> *Getting backlinks doesn't happen overnight.*

> *It's a process that requires long-term investment if you want it to
> pay dividends in organic traffic. The landing pages created by Canva
> to rank for transactional queries like "infographic maker" or
> "certificate templates" haven't picked up all those backlinks by
> chance.* ***Canva has intentionally invested in these pages to capture
> backlinks from third parties such as bloggers and journalists.***

> *Canva has developed a team of outreach specialists who identify
> content that mentions things like "invitations," "posters" or "digital
> marketing tools." Then they reach out to the creators.*

> [--- Foundation Inc, The Canva Backlink Empire: How SEO, Outreach &
> Content Led To A \$6B
> Valuation](https://foundationinc.co/lab/canva-seo){.markup--anchor
> .markup--blockquote-anchor
> data-href="https://foundationinc.co/lab/canva-seo" rel="noopener"
> target="_blank"}

☝️*FYI*, that's a backlink I just gave --- making that article more
visible in search.

By being very intentional about getting more backlinks, Canva has come
to dominate SEO.

### Strategy 4: Staying on top of consumer trends {#07c1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="07c1"}

**Canva creates content in response to new demand,** keeping them
relevant and always in the conversation, and creating new lead magnets
around the zeitgeist.

> *The rise of remote work around the world led to a massive increase in
> the adoption of Zoom. Teleconferencing software was one of the most
> popular SaaS industries during the initial wave of COVID-19.*

> *At first glance, it doesn't seem like Canva would benefit much from
> the rise of telecommuting and remote work --- but they did.*

> *The increased demand for Zoom resulted in the increased demand for
> custom Zoom backgrounds. Take a look at this Google Trends track for
> the query "Zoom Background":*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SW1GqNDDBR9lD4sX.png){.graf-image
image-id="0*SW1GqNDDBR9lD4sX.png" data-width="1456" data-height="727"}

**When demand spiked, Canva reacted by developing a new vertical
dedicated to Zoom backgrounds**. They spun up new landing pages to match
search intent, and they even went to Product Hunt to drum up some
interest. *How startup-like.*

And that's the high-level view of how Canva is using content and SEO to
grow. The last driver of growth we'll look at (very briefly) is how
Canva is expanding internationally.

### Going global → localization & partnerships {#7e20 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="7e20"}

**With Canva, it's very clear that international expansion is a key part
of their growth. They've invested heavily in localization, as well as
building in-country growth teams.**

Today, they're in 190 countries and the platform is available in 100
languages. And with each new country/language Canva focused on
supporting, their total addressable market got bigger.

Here's Cameron Adams talking about localization at Canva:

> *The first version of our product was something that we were proud of,
> but it was also only something that you could use if you spoke
> English.* ***Something that played a massive role in our early growth
> was making Canva a tool that* anyone *in the world can pick up****.
> This is often phrased in two different ways: internationalization and
> localization. Very broadly speaking, internationalization is about the
> nuts of bolts of offering your product in different languages, whereas
> localization is about making it appropriate for every users' context
> and culture.*

> *For us,* ***it's how we think about expanding into new global markets
> by building hyperlocal products --- ones that are not only available
> in different languages but have culturally relevant and engaging
> features and content libraries that feel truly local.*** *This creates
> a really powerful network effect where word-of-mouth and social
> sharing are some of our largest growth drivers, helping us build a
> strong community of Canva advocates across the globe --- many of whom
> then create and grow build their own Canva communities.*
