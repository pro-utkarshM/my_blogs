Reddit boasts a rich history as both the first company from Y-Combinator
to launch and the first significant acquisition for a YC company.
Interestingly, this marks our 10th case study on a company that
originated in a dorm room, with previous coverage of Snapchat, Tinder,
Stitch Fix, DoorDash, DoNotPay, Morning Brew, Snackpass, Superpowered,
and Stripe. What sets Reddit apart from other student-founded companies
we've covered is that they did not rely on university social circles for
their initial launch and acquisition of their first customers. Let's
dive into the details of their early success story.

#### The founding¬†story {#39fc .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="39fc"}

"In 2003, Alexis Ohanian, a History major, and Steve Huffman, a Computer
Science major, were roommates in the University of Virginia gaming room
when they developed the entrepreneurial dream. Their initial idea was a
food-ordering app named mmmüòã(MyMobileMenu) with the goal of making the
world a better place. For a year, they conducted extensive market
research, created databases of restaurants in Virginia, attended
entrepreneurship events worldwide, registered a company, and opened a
bank account, but they did not launch the app.

During their senior year, Steve's girlfriend informed him that Paul
Graham (PG) was going to give a talk on startups in Boston during their
spring break. Although Steve knew PG from his book On Lisp, Alexis was
unfamiliar with him. Steve convinced Alexis to accompany him to the
talk, hoping to learn how to launch their app. After Paul finished his
talk, they approached him with a Hail-Mary."

> *Hey, Dr. Graham and told him it would be worth the cost of buying him
> a drink if he'd listen to us talk about our start-up. He said, "You
> came all the way up from Virginia? Sure‚Ää---‚ÄäAlexis Ohanian recounting
> the founding story*

#### Getting into¬†YC {#09c9 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--blockquote name="09c9"}

This coffee chat would change the lives of Alexis and Steve and make
them millionaires in their early twenties. They spent the time pitching
*mmm(not to be confused with*
[*mmhmm*](https://www.mmhmm.app){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.mmhmm.app" rel="noopener" target="_blank"}*)* and
how they were going to make waiting in line a thing of the past. PG got
excited. Two hours into their conversation, Paul invited them to
interview for the new startup incubator's first-ever batch he was
building called YCombinator.

The actual pitch went well, but did not gain enough of a traction with
the investors to secure them a spot in the first-ever YC batch.

Then, out of nowhere, a day after their rejection and on their way back
to Virginia...Paul called up the young founders to reverse his decision.

> *"I get a call from Paul. He says, "I'm sorry, we made a mistake. We
> don't like your idea, but we like you guys." We got off the train, and
> I was able to sweet-talk the Amtrak lady into not charging us to turn
> around. In our conversation, Paul said, "You guys need to build the
> front page of the Internet." That was all Paul, and that became
> Reddit."‚Ää---‚ÄäAlexis Ohanian*

**Fun Fact:** Alexis drew the first Snoo (Reddit's mascot) during his
senior year in college (University of Virginia), even before the
company's idea. He used Illustrator and the touchpad on his laptop to
draw Snoo.

#### The launch that the founders did not know¬†about. {#43d0 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="43d0"}

After spending a year researching their food delivery concept, YC and PG
gave the Reddit team about 2 weeks to launch "the homepage of the
internet."

To take a step back, at the time, this was not an entirely green field;
the competition was steep. Digg (which had a similar ambition) announced
a "large" series A of \$2.8m (yup, that was considered "large" back
then) just as Steve and Alexis were getting started on Reddit. To add
salt to injury, Digg was founded by a minor tech celebrity *Kevin Rose.*
The deadline and pressure from YC stemmed from this competitive pressure
and perhaps arguably the fact that they wanted to have some demonstrable
wins from their first ever batch.

At the end of the two weeks, Paul sent the cofounders a scathing email
saying

> *You guys hadn't launched yet because you are incompetent in which
> case you are hosed or you re just worried about being perfect in which
> case you are still hosed because you would still need to launch it
> anyway and need to deal with the fact that it is not
> perfect‚Ää---‚ÄäAlexis Recaps in a youtube interview*

Steve took the email personally and replied saying he had managed to get
the fundamentals to work... and just a few weeks after, PG forced their
hand to launch when he referenced Reddit in his famous [What I did this
summer](http://www.paulgraham.com/sfp.html){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/sfp.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} essay, where he unleashed YC into the
world.

Just like that, Reddit was launched (without the founders knowledge or
blessing), traffic was spiking¬†...but Steve as you can imagine....was
not too happy about how it all went down.

> *I didn't know he was going to do that," Steve says. "The Slashdot
> comments were panning Reddit. This one guy wrote a blog post about how
> sh\*tty Reddit was. It was a frustrating day.*

With that unplanned launch, just a day in, Reddit got over their first
1000 user mark.

Deep Dive üßê: Launching before you're ready.
```

``` {#af14 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
In the Silicon Valley gospel, Reed Hoffman pinned the "If You're Not Embarrassed By The First Version Of Your Product, You've Launched Too Late." But taking every one-size-fits-all startup advice to heart can be dangerous...look no further than Reddit.
```

``` {#75be .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
Reddit launching a semi-baked product meant that the founders would spend the following months in disarray. They got hammered by the tech bloggers circle( drawing unfavorable comparisons to Digg). They had no fundamental mechanics to retain or engage that first cohort of users. All of which translated into Reddit losing every customer they gained from the launch. They went from 0 customers to 1000+ back to 0 in 48 hours.
```

``` {#eed0 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
Launching too early might work well when you are testing out a new consumer behavior (as with Airbnb), a new business model(as with Spotify), or where first to market would be a massive competitive advantage to your business (as with Linkedin). In many other cases, specifically when entering a crowded/established space with already established consumer habits...the bar of expectations your initial product needs to meet is high.
```

``` {#e92c .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
For instance, if you are building a new Fitness app or a competitor to a startup that had more firepower (i.e. üí∞), a more established team, and a famous founder (as was the case with Reddit)...take your time building the right product, with the right experience for customers, one that can outshine your competition üòÅ. Sometimes, the right thing to make is an MVP you're proud of, not embarrassed!
```

#### The disappointing road to¬†2k. {#6ee4 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--pre name="6ee4"}

Q: You know what's worse than a launch you, the founders, did not know
about?

A: What comes next.

After launching Reddit, the founders faced several challenges. They had
no clear plan on how to acquire users, their website was barely
functional, and their competitor was looming. In an attempt to achieve
critical mass, the founders resorted to creating fake users to bolster
Reddit's credibility. Every day, Alexis and Ohanian would use the admin
view they created on the website to attach a new fake user to any new
post they created. They posted dozens of new links every day to make the
website appear more legitimate. This tactic superficially lent Reddit
credibility, but more importantly, it did two critical things:

1- **It set the tone for the website.** In many instances of building a
company, looking for the unintended use cases of your product can be a
powerful signal for future feature and product development. But on a
pseudonymous community-first website, you can see how that can be
problematic. Having the founder DNA firmly embedded throughout the early
history of posts set the culture, the unhidden rules, and the
expectation of what Reddit is very clearly and powerfully.

Showing new users how they ought to use the platform is arguably a lot
more effective than telling them through FAQs, guidelines,
tutorials..etc. (who reads those anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

2- **Made people feel they were part of something real.** With hundreds
of (fake) users each having a distinct digital presence, user #003 would
feel they were part of something so much bigger than they were; no one
wants to be a part of a ghost town, but some, I would suspect, would
love to be a part of a vibrant emerging community on the internet.

Fun Fact: Some of these suspected fake users are

Deep Dive üßê: Establishing Trust
```

``` {#2787 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
One important aspect here that we barely touched upon is Trust. Trust is a critical ingredient in the success of any company...big or small.   
```

``` {#69a9 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
But the way we think of Trust is frequently flawed; when we think of Trust, we often think about how we can establish Trust, yet what we fail to realize is that we are wired to be trusting as human beings skepticism by nature.
```

``` {#860d .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
Clinical psychologist Doris Brothers succinctly put it, "Trust rarely occupies the foreground of conscious awareness. We are no more likely to ask ourselves how trusting we are at any given moment than to inquire if gravity is still keeping the planets in orbit."  
```

``` {#b195 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
Re-building Trust is a more appropriate phenomenon for what we see many emerging companies do. Users come in with a default trusting instinct. In many ways, those companies quickly erode that Trust by things like slow loading time, aggressive marketing copy, opaque pricing, and asking for private information such as emails, phone numbers, social security numbers..etc. and then attempt to rebuild this eroded Trust via social-proof, case studies..etc 
```

``` {#3946 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
What Reddit did, in the early days, was to work exceptionally diligently not to lose that initial user trust. They did that by doing two things:
```

``` {#5a20 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre}
- Having no censorship. Reddit was an actual public square where no arbiter of truth can control what can or can not be posted on the website (obviously, they had to walk back on that in the years to come, and user-moderation became a heavy part of how the company operates). 
- Not collecting any identifiable information for new users. No emails, no phone numbers, IP address..etc. If you opt-in to create a Reddit account, then all you needed was a username and password. That's it. 
```

``` {#7529 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre .graf--trailing}
This small yet meaningful effort in not losing that initial Trust combined with meeting customer expectations of being a "homepage of the internet" (through these fake, highly curated posts) gave Reddit an earnest shot of building something truly spectacular.
