### From Zero to Thousands: How Atlassian Bootstrapped Its Way to Its Initial Customers {#bf81 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="bf81"}

The world's functioning is significantly reliant on developers.
Technology companies account for 20--30% of the global market
capitalization, which is not surprising. However, what is surprising is
that only around 25--30 million developers are responsible for writing
the underlying software. This represents less than 0.4% of the world's
population!

> The world desperately needs (a) more developers and (b) more
> productive developers. And the company we speak of today is at the
> center of both trends.

Atlassian is a company that specializes in software development and
collaboration. Its mission is to enable every team to reach its full
potential. The company's products, including Jira, Confluence, Trello,
and Bitbucket, among others, are used by over 15 million users at more
than 230,000 companies worldwide. In the fiscal year 2021, Atlassian
generated a revenue of more than \$2 billion. The company was founded by
Scott and Mike, who started the business from scratch and managed to
attract 1,000 and then 10,000 customers. They eventually created a
one-of-a-kind "acquisition-led growth" engine that is unlike anything
the world has ever seen.

**Starting with a big terrible idea... the first 10s of customers**

Like several legendary startups before it, Atlassian started with a
*self-proclaimed* terrible idea. Scott and Mike were fans of a Swedish
software product that helped companies manage and run their internet
infrastructure (like servers). It was built by a team renowned for
writing great software but one that did not feel the need to offer
customer support. The big idea? Providing third-party support services
to customers of this company who were primarily in the US, from
Australia. Sound like a recipe for disaster? It was!

> The biggest problem... Scott and Mike needed a repeatable source of
> customer leads.

They realized that the Swedish product didn't have any documentation for
developers and customers to use. So they wrote the documentation
themselves and published it on the internet for FREE! The hope was that
the documentation would serve as a wedge to gain mindshare amongst
customers of the software! But not unlike most hacks, it both worked and
backfired at the same time. The documentation the pair wrote was so
good, that customers who did reach out, didn't need support services to
solve **trivial problems** --- the bread and butter of the support
services industry. Instead, Atlassian had opened Pandora's box of the
hardest possible customer support requests timed at the most ungodly
hours!

> "We kept getting phone calls at 4 am in the morning 😣 and my
> girlfriend at the time was very unhappy with this business." --- Mike

Scott and Mike faced financial difficulties due to the extended service
times required to solve most requests, which took several hours. In
addition, their pricing strategy was relatively modest, charging only
\$300 per successful resolution of the issue. It's worth noting that
they only received payment when they succeeded in resolving the issue.

### The birth of Jira and the journey from 100 to 1000 customers {#ebbe .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ebbe"}

Scott and Mike's true passion was in developing software, not supporting
it, even as they built a services company. They developed a range of
software tools internally to enhance the efficiency of their services
business, including an app to publish documentation online, a Content
Management System (CMS), a tool to track website visitors, an email
archiving tool, and an issue tracking system named Atlassian Support
System, which was later renamed after a friend pointed out the
abbreviation.

While building these tools, they realized that there was a lack of
scaffolding to build internet businesses in the 2000s. The tools they
developed for their business could be beneficial for thousands of other
internet-based businesses. They decided to commercialize and sell their
internal issue tracking system, called ASS, which became the foundation
for Jira.

Initially, Atlassian marketed Jira as a simple issue and bug tracking
tool for software developers. The reason for targeting software
developers was that they were among the earliest adopters of
internet-based businesses and faced significant challenges in tracking
and resolving software issues.

> "Software developers were great audience because they **went and found
> tools** to solve their problems and they **worked with a lot of other
> groups** inside those companies"

Within the first year of launch, Atlassian scaled to 300+ customers,
within the next year the company grew over 3x to 1000+ customers.

Here's what worked:

***#1: Getting drunk at conferences! 🍺***

Atlassian recognized that a large chunk of potential customers
aggregated at tech conferences --- like the JavaOne conference in San
Fransisco. However, booths cost anywhere between \$20--50k --- something
Atlassian couldn't afford. Being the hacky 22-year-olds they were,
Atlassian employed some guerilla tactics ahead of a popular session
called "Java posse". Prior to the event, **Scott and Mike trucked in
about 15 to 20 cases of beer** for attendees and slapped Atlassian
labels on them.

> *The free drinks were such a success that the* ***speakers at the
> event gave Atlassian a great shout-out****, the team got mentioned in
> a popular podcast, and for about \$3000 of cost (beer), Atlassian
> scored booth space worth several 10s of thousands of dollars!*

***#2: Make your customers your billboard 👕***

Atlassian soon turned into an apparel company shipping about 10,000
tee-shirts to customers around the world. But there was a catch. Only
the customers who bought the most expensive version of our product got a
T-shirt.

> *"So you have to pay an extra \$3000 for a T-shirt and it turns out
> that quite a few people would say later on --- Yeah, I wasn't sure
> which version to go with, but I found out that I get a tee shirt with
> the 3000 dollar version and so I splurged for it."*

*Atlassian shipped 10,000s of T-shirts in its early days and now runs a
full-fledged e-commerce apparel store! 🤯*

target="_blank"}

***#3: Always be marketing 🔄 Using every opportunity to sell***

Atlassian went as far as marketing themselves and their culture on their
404 not found and 500 pages on their website!

*An early Atlassian 404 not found page*

***#4: Make everything into a campaign --- even recruitment 👔***

Atlassian marketed their employees relentlessly and even turned
recruitment into an opportunity to run a marketing campaign.

> The company paid **internal referrals a \$10,000 bounty** to recruit
> staff and gave **external people \$2,000**.

They limited recruiters to a ceiling of 4 candidates sent or they
wouldn't do any more business with them.

### 📈 Going multi-product! Scaling past 1,000 to 10,000 customers {#e75d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e75d"}

Jira became a popular product in the early 2000s, and by 2004, it had
become a breakout product in a rapidly expanding market. The product was
no longer limited to bug and issue tracking for developers and was
increasingly being used by other teams, such as marketing, design, and
operations teams, for project management.

At this point, Atlassian made an unconventional decision. Conventional
wisdom suggested that if a product like Jira was successful, the company
should focus solely on it rather than invest in developing a new
product. However, Jira's viral success with other teams and its
expanding use cases beyond issue tracking caught the founders'
attention.

> At the time, Wiki technology was gaining traction in the developer
> market. The founders took that as an opportunity to build an internal
> knowledge-sharing platform for developers and other allied teams.
> **They called the platform, Confluence. And the bet paid off!**

The combination of Jira and Confluence changed the growth trajectory of
Atlassian. By 2007, Atlassian had\~10,000 customers in close to 100
countries. Within a short span of time, Atlassian found its way into the
toolkits of the largest companies in the world --- Cisco, Oracle,
Citigroup, Nokia, AT&T, you name it.

> "We had two rocket engines driving us along, not just one." --- Mike

### 🚀 Acquisition-led growth and the path to \$85B+ market cap {#d326 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="d326"}

Powered by the early profitability around flagship products like Jira
and Confluence, Atlassian was aggressive in bolstering their early
product lines with acquisitions. Authentisoft for SSO & Authentication,
Clover + Crucible for code coverage and review, and Fisheye for
accessing repositories. Fast forward 14 years, the company has invested
north of \$1B, across 18 acquisitions and 12 investments to fill product
gaps (speed to market), enhance capabilities (talent and IP) and expand
markets.

image-id="0*yeAmh2URHyYeO3ex.png" data-width="501" data-height="209"}

*Atlassian's key acquisitions*

What's even more interesting is the M&A engine's contribution to
Atlassian's topline --- 25% leading up to the IPO to 40% as of today.
The effect of acquisitions on Atlassian's growth rate is even more
astounding.

> *Atlassian's core non-acquired businesses (Jira and Confluence) grew
> 4x since IPO (24% CAGR) as vs. their acquisition heavy business lines
> which grew at roughly 8x (38% CAGR) during the same time period!*

Borrowing from Jamin Ball's latest analysis on public market multiples
for high growth (30%+ YoY) companies vs. mid growth (15--30%) companies,
it isn't unfair to claim that **somewhere between 50--60% of Atlassian's
\$85B market cap finds its roots in acquired assets!**

### 🤿 Deep dive: How Atlassian became the most successful acquirer of assets {#ed4d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ed4d"}

Atlassian's acquisition playbook has 4 carefully built out components:

1.  [Deal identification 🔍]{#dee0}
2.  [Deal execution 🏃🏻‍♀️]{#9431}
3.  [Post-acquisition integration, and 🔀]{#8ec3}
4.  [The team that does it 👥]{#c533}

> **Deal Identification** at Atlassian stems from the realization that
> even with the best R&D team, one cannot hold a monopoly over
> innovation.

Many of Atlassian's acquisitions are borne from a need to Transform
existing products and Augment reach to adjacent areas thereby giving the
customer a one-stop tool. These requirements flow from agile feedback
loops generated at the customer level, championed by product owners, and
masterfully executed by the M&A vertical --- a small but powerful unit
reporting directly to the Co-CEOs.

> "**Deal execution** at Atlassian stands out from the rest of the M&A
> world, in its genuine attempts to make the process
> **seller-friendly**."

An unprecedented move in 2019 saw Atlassian[**open-source its M&A
term**](https://editorial.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ED/pages/262284/The+Atlassian+Term+Sheet){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://editorial.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ED/pages/262284/The+Atlassian+Term+Sheet"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} **sheet** thereby making the process
fairer and more transparent. Terms around Escrow funds
(indemnification), against senior talent earnouts (linking employee
payouts to rigid goals), and special reps (against IP/Legal claims)
further position Atlassian as a seller-friendly acquirer.

> "We believe we can cut some of the friction by focusing on the terms
> that actually matter to us, not the terms we can get just because
> we're bigger than the companies we acquire." --- **Chrish Hecht, Head
> of Corporate Development, Atlassian**

Managing cultural differences and **post-acquisition integration** are
considered as make or break plays in the M&A ecosystem. At Atlassian, a
dedicated team, working with playbooks for financial, people, and
systems integration aligns the acquiree with the goals & processes of
the organization and streamlines an otherwise uncertain transition.
Atlassian maps their renowned values to those of a potential acquiree,
conducts leadership kick-off summits, draws out product and employee
roadmaps, allocates additional resourcing to account for
during-integration productivity losses among other well laid out
programs to address concerns around integrations.

> "We really want to look at these acquisitions in more of a partnership
> mode and helping them to stand up their operations and grow roots in
> the company long term" --- **Christina Amiry, Head of M&A Strategic
> Operations at Atlassian**
