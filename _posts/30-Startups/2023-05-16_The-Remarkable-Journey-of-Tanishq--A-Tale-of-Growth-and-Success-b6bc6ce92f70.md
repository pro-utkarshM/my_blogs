Tanishq was born in 1994 as a brand under the umbrella of Titan Company
Limited, a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu
Industrial Development Corporation. The brand aimed to redefine the
jewelry industry in India, which was largely unorganized and lacked
standardized practices. Tanishq set out to change this by introducing
professionalism, transparency, and a new level of customer experience.

**2. Quality and Craftsmanship:**\
Right from its inception, Tanishq focused on delivering impeccable
quality and craftsmanship. The brand established its own
state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities equipped with advanced
technology and skilled artisans. Tanishq's commitment to quality is
reflected in its certification processes, where each piece undergoes
stringent quality checks to ensure that customers receive nothing but
the best.

pursuit of innovation and design excellence. The brand has constantly
pushed boundaries by infusing traditional jewelry with contemporary
elements, catering to the evolving tastes of its customers. Tanishq's

collections.

The brand has invested significantly in understanding consumer
preferences, conducting market research, and gathering insights to offer
jewelry that resonates with its target audience. In addition, Tanishq
has fostered strong relationships with its customers through
personalized services, such as customization options, expert guidance,
and after-sales support, ensuring an unforgettable shopping experience.

**5. Retail Expansion and Omni-channel Presence:**\
To cater to a wider customer base, Tanishq embarked on an aggressive
retail expansion strategy. The brand strategically opened stores across
various cities, both in urban and semi-urban areas, expanding its reach
and accessibility. Recognizing the growing trend of online shopping,
Tanishq also established a robust e-commerce platform, allowing
customers to browse and purchase their favorite jewelry from the comfort
of their homes.

**6. Trust and Ethical Practices:**\
In an industry where trust plays a vital role, Tanishq has built a
strong reputation for its ethical practices and integrity. The brand
ensures the authenticity of its products by providing certifications for
gold and gemstones. Moreover, Tanishq's commitment to responsible
sourcing, sustainable practices, and fair trade has resonated with

commitment to quality, design innovation, and customer satisfaction.
