Hello Folks ðŸ‘‹,

I know a lot of ink has been spilled over **Twitter's founding** but
what I discovered throughout this research was that the origin of
Twitter dates back to the year 2000.

At that time, Jack Dorsey started getting into a personalized blogging
website *Live Journal*. Live Journal was (and still is) a platform for
people to follow their favorite bloggers and get a customized feed based
on the social graph of bloggers you follow. Jack loved it and wanted to
create a similar feed but for status updates. The idea was to see an
archive of someone's status updates on Instant Messaging in hopes it
could translate to more lifetime interactions (if I see a group of your
friends on the feed updated their status to visiting a particular
location/ festival, I could call them and meet up..etc.)

To bring his idea into reality, Jack wrote a script to forward emails
sent from his email to an email list of his closest friends and family
(revolutionary, I know ðŸ˜¬). Shortly after writing the software, Jack
went to the Golden Gate Park to test it and typed out a status update
email that he was @ Golden Gate Park watching Bisons if any of his
friends or family cared to join. No one showed up or replied...but the
idea for Twitter was well planted.

Six years pass by, and Jack finds himself working as a software
developer at Odeo, a podcasting company started by Noah Glass and Evan
Williams. Noah and Evan had previously sold Blogger to Google. Jack was
in an interesting situation at Odeo; no one at the company was a
consumer of the tool, podcasting was not a life passion for any of the
cofounders, and the company wasn't taking off as they hoped it gave. A
room for groups within the company to come up and work on new ideas
rose, and Jack capitalized on that to bring his IM status archive to
life.

The timing worked; the rise of popularity of cross-platform SMS service
between different mobile carriers. Together with Biz Stone and a
freelance software developer in Hamburg, Germany, they could knock out
V0.1 of Twttr in 2 weeks.

**Acquiring customers**

The Twitter product was by no measure an instant success. It took 3
months for the service to get their first 1000 customers, followed by
another 3 months of slowing growth after their initial spike. It was not
until 6 months of releasing the product that it started showing some
resemblance of working out. Considering Twitter was a side project
within Odeo I am (gratefully) surprised that they stuck with it for that
long and continued investing in the project.

The first spike in user signups for Twitter came when cofounder Ev
Williams wrote the blog post "Twitter is alive" on his personal blog
[evhead.com](http://evhead.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://evhead.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. Ev being
the creator of [blogger.com](http://blogger.com/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://blogger.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} (and later Twttr and Medium) had some resemblance of
online influence and his post would help attract about 150 new signups
to the platform.

Two days after Ev's blog post, [Om
Malik](https://twitter.com/om?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://twitter.com/om?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, who had recently quit his job to pursue
blogging full-time on his personal blog "Gigaom", wrote a post about
Twttr which you can still read it
[here](https://gigaom.com/2006/07/15/valleys-all-twttr/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://gigaom.com/2006/07/15/valleys-all-twttr/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

A day after the Om Malik's blog post, Techcrunch's cofounder Michael
Arrington would write the first of many Techcrunch pieces on the service
(read

.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}).

Combined these three posts combined attracted more than 1500 new users
to the service...bringing the total user base to just above 2000 after
100 days of releasing the product.

**The next growth spurt**

Following the publicity boost in July 2006, Twitter growth would start
to decelerate for a couple of months before picking up steam towards the
end of 2006 and finally get a much-needed booster in the south by
southwest tech conference in March 2007 (which also happens to be when
the company turned 1). As Ev explains on Quora

> *I got a request to answer this question, though contrary to common
> belief, we didn't launch Twitter at SXSWâ€Š---â€ŠSXSW just chose to blow
> it up.*

> *We launched it nine months beforeâ€Š---â€Što a whimper. By the time SXSW
> 2007 rolled around, we were starting to grow finally, and it seemed
> like all of our users (probably in the thousands) were going to Austin
> that year. So, we did two things to take advantage of the emerging
> critical mass:*

-   [We created a Twitter visualizer and negotiated with the festival to
    put flat panel screens in the hallways. This is something they'd
    never done before, but we didn't want a booth on the trade show
    floor because we knew hallways is where the action was. We paid
    \$11K for this and set up the TVs ourselves. (This was about the
    only money Twitter's *ever* spent on marketing.)]{#5b36}
-   [We created an event-specific feature, where, you could text 'join
    sxsw' to 40404. Then you would show up on the screens. And, if you
    weren't already a Twitter user, you'd automatically be following a
    half-dozen or so "ambassadors," who were Twitter users also at SXSW.
    We advertised this on the screens in the hallways. (I don't know how
    many people signed up this wayâ€Š---â€Šmy recollection is not a
    lot.)]{#df74}

> *I don't know the most critical factor, but networks are all about
> critical mass, so doubling down on the momentum seemed like a good
> idea. And something clicked.*

**Twitter as we know it**

Twitter would go on to capitalize on this moment by raising their first
venture money of \$5.5m lead by Fred Wilson @ Union Square Venture and
spin out Twitter from Odeo as a separate product. A few months later, a
light earthquake would hit San Francisco and SF twitter would light up
with inquiries about the quake...shining light on a new product
direction that would take the service from an internet archive of status
updates to a real-time newsfeed of everything that is going on in the
world that we know today.
