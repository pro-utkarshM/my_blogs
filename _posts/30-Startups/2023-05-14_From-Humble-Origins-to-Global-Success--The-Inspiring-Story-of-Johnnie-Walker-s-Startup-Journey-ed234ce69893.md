Hello everyone, brand image is one of the most essential and perhaps the
most difficult aspect of marketing. It takes years to build a brand
image costs you a million, sometimes even a billion dollars and if not
done right, it could even kill a century old brand.

And especially when it comes to the spirit business brand image is so
crucial that it can literally make or break your business. However,
Johnnie Walker is one of those brands that has practically mastered the
art of brand communication and the legacy of Johnnie Walker has
continued for 200 years.\
And this legacy makes **Johnnie Walker** a marketing masterpiece to
learn from what started out as an obsession for consistent tasting
whiskey by a grocery boy then went on to become a business empire that
has spanned for 4 generations and scaled across 180 countries, but after
150 years of being the most popular whiskey brand in the world, by the
end of 20th century Johnnie Walker faced one of the most difficult
challenges\
faced by every age old brand and that is identity crisis, but the way
they reacted to this crisis taught the world an incredible lesson in
marketing.

This is a story that dates back to 1999 wherein within a span of just 3
years Johnnie Walker saw a disastrous decline in sales by 14% and when
the board actually dug in to find out what exactly was wrong they
discovered that Johnnie Walker had 27 campaigns running all across the
world.\
Each of these campaigns had a different message and the brand really had
not substantial image of itself.

Apart from this, the mega trend in the 1980s and the 1990s was inclining
towards wine and vodka and the popularity of whiskey as a drink fell
drastically among the American consumers. And this mega trend led to a
20% decline in the whiskey sales volume. This is when the parent company
of Johnnie Walker, Diageo stepped in and they brought together an
amazing team of marketeers just so that they can understand how can they
revive the brand and build a brand image that can stand tall in the
modern age.

**And guess what ?**\
The campaign that they designed turned out to be so magical that within
the next 15 years, it turned Johnny Walker into a \$2.2 billion brand.\
And not just that the slogans of Johnnie Walker became so popular\
that they became a part of the pro democracy protest. The question is\
What was so amazing about this campaign and how did a whiskey tagline\
go on to inspire a protest slogan ?

*The answer* to this question lies in the super intense market research
done by Johnnie Walker marketeers and after doing a detailed survey,
they realised that there were 3 major problems with the brand. Number
one\
whiskey was being viewed as an old man's drink because of which the
youth did not connect with any whiskey brand, in general. Secondly, all
across the world since they had 27 campaigns running **Parallelly** each
one of them had a different message because of which no one had any
clear idea about what exactly is the brand persona of Johnnie Walker.
For example everybody knows that Nike is all about being bold and
pursuing greatness. Apple is all about being different and being
creative Tesla is all about the future and going green. But Johnnie
Walker did not have anything concrete associated with it and third and
most importantly\
the narrative of the marketing message was just self obsessed and it
almost looked like bragging. It was all about 'We the Johnnie Walker are
the most awarded scotch in the world.

> We the Johnnie Walker have a heritage of 150 years.\
> We the Johnnie Walker are a premium brand.' and so on and so forth.

And this narrative developed a disconnect with the audience So you know
what ? The marketeers of Johnnie Walker took 3 radical steps which
redefined Johnnie Walker to the world. Number one they killed all their
campaigns and put together a team that would work specifically on
communicating just one core message. And they said instead of pleasing
everybody let's just stand by our core values and appeal to only a
limited segment of people who would believe in what we believe.

Secondly, they changed the striding man himself and instead of the old
cartoon figure who was full of personality, wit and charm they decided
to rebuild it into something more modern, something more minimalistic
and sleek. This was done just so that it could appeal to a younger
audience.\
And last and most importantly the most crucial step that they took\
was to change the narrative of the marketing message. That is, instead
of talking about themselves they said, 'Let's talk about you, the
customers.'\
Instead of coming out with their own ideas and assumptions about
masculinity they directly went and spoke to their ideal customers that
is, men of the age of 25--35.

Now, this was a huge survey that was conducted all across the world just
so that they could understand what is their audience's idea of success
and this gave them a golden insight. While most brands assume that\
men are lured by materialistic success like having a fancy car or a rich
lifestyle.

The marketeers of Johnnie Walker discovered that more than the external
success, it was the inner sense of progress, the inner confidence that
their customers valued the most and the fact that to a man, whiskey was
an embodiment of his own personality and they always want to hold on to
something that represented what they truly believed in. And all of this
boiled down to one key marketing message and that is to keep walking
inspite of the obstacles.

And this is what inspired the iconic 'Keep Walking' campaign and this
campaign did not speak a word about whiskey instead it spoke obsessively
about the customers. Instead of saying 'We are the most awarded scotch.\
We have a heritage of 100 years.' Their marketing message said 'If you
have the spirit to deal with the obstacles of your life If you believe
in achieving greatness inspite of the pitfalls If you believe in
becoming a better version of yourself every single day. Let us be your
companion to keep you walking.\
Johnny Walker, keep walking.' and they featured the stories of great
individuals like Lincoln's quote in the print magazine to depict the
fact that\
Lincoln kept walking inspite of all the obstacles in life only to become
a legendary president. In media, they featured the great footballer
Roberto Baggio wherein he overcame his nightmare of missing the penalty
at the 1994 World Cup final. And guess what ? Soon enough the campaign
was on fire within the next few years Johnnie Walker went from having a
sales decline to seeing a tremendous sales increase by almost a 100% in
the next 15 years wherein they sold 19 million 9 litre cases as compared
to 10 million in 1999.

This is how, Johnnie Walker established a legacy in advertising and
since then they have constantly brought along new derivatives of their
'Keep Walking' campaign. And these campaigns range all the way from
topical to historic events just so that they could keep striking a cord
with the audience. And one of the 'Keep Walking' campaigns held in
Brazil in 2011\
had become such a symbol of perseverance and determination\
that when the Brazil protest erupted in 2013 people turned the "Keep
Walking" slogan into "Keep Fighting" and held the slogan to state their
determination to achieve change and apart from the vogue image\
Johnnie Walker is so keen on catching up with the new age marketing
strategies that they are one of the first spirit brands to experiment
with social media and influencer marketing strategies.

And this move speaks volumes about how much they have learnt as a brand\
from their own mistakes. Now there are 3 very important lessons\
that we need to take out of this Johnnie Walker case study. Number one,
perceived value is underrated. If you take a step back, you will realise
that I did not speak a word about how Johnnie Walker was trying to make
their whiskey tastier or smoother. The entire turnaround was brought
along, not because Johnnie Walker tasted better because it's still the
exact same whiskey served in the exact same bottle that was sold 100
years back.\
the only thing that changed was the story of the brand that turned it's
tables around eventually, made a billion dollars. Lesson 2, no brand is
too big to falter you might have a 200 year old legacy, you might be
spread across 180 countries but if you do not pay attention to the
fundamental truths of consumer perception it is only a matter of time
that you'd go from an icon\
to being a forgotten icon. Unfortunately, Old Monk is a standing example
of the same. And last and most importantly every marketeer needs to
understand that every consumer, knowingly or unknowingly looks for a
product that is an embodiment of his/her own personality and the job of
the marketeer is not to tell the story of the brand but to tell the
story of the consumer himself because at the end of the day the
perception of the brand is nothing but the reflection of the customer's
personality. And hence, the narrative must always be about the customer
and not about the company. From here, Johnnie Walker taught the world an
incredible marketing lesson on how to build a timeless brand. That's all
from my side for today guys.
